<p>
While you can start a PuTTY window maximised by Windows mechanisms,
currently there's no way to start it full-screen. There should be.

<p>
While we're at it, we may as have well an option for `maximised', even
though you can already do that
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#QA.6.1">by other means</a>.

<p>
If we're going to do this, we should perhaps also propagate
maximised-ness and full-screen-ness through Duplicate Session
(duplicate a currently maximised session and the next one comes up
that way too). Then again, perhaps not; I'm not sure whether it's
really helpful to have <em>two</em> full-screen PuTTYs open at once.
At least one user definitely wants it to work this way for maximised
windows, though.

<p>
This should perhaps be considered in the context of
<a href="resize.html">a general overhaul of resize handling</a>.
