Summary: time() returning (time_t)-1 is mishandled

In various places, PuTTY calls time() and passes the result straight to
localtime() without checking whether the result was (time_t)-1, which
indicates that time() couldn't return the correct answer.  Doing this
invokes undefined behaviour (a GPF on Windows), which is Bad.  PuTTY
should do something more sensible when presented with (time_t)-1.
