the local host and demonstrates an issue found while using mercurial.  I  
have looked through your existing bug list but failed to spot anything  
similar.

This particular instance of "Unable to read from standard input" should
be fixed now:

The answer, currently, is `I don't know'. It certainly fixes _a_ bug which
gives rise to that error message: if you do something along the lines of

  echo -e 'wibble\nscrark' | plink foovax sort

then you should now no longer get that error.

However, I can't be sure that the same error when doing complicated things
launched from a service is due to the same Windows error, so it might not fix
all instances of the problem. This is why I also added more detailed error
reporting to that error message, so that if any instances of the problem remain
we'll have more information with which to investigate them.
