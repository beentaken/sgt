<p>
Diffie-Hellman group exchange was implemented in PuTTY some years ago
(it's been present since 0.52).

<p>
However, the final version of
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/secsh/draft-ietf-secsh-dh-group-exchange/">draft-ietf-secsh-dh-group-exchange</a>
added a new key exchange method relative to earlier drafts, using SHA-256
instead of SHA-1. We should implement that too.

<p>
(<em>Update:</em> Note that this support was liable to crash in snapshots
before r6606, 2006-03-13.)
