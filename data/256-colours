Summary: Support for more colours

<p>It's been suggested that PuTTY could usefully support xterm's 256-colour
mode.  This would involve having rather more storage for character attributes
than at present, which in the present (0.55) design of PuTTY would mean using
64 bits to store each character of scrollback, which is slightly ludicrous.
When we get around to redesigning the scrollback format so as not to use
so much memory, adding more attribute bits might become feasible.

<p>&lt;1042233614.1153.15.camel@evilmagic.org&gt; contains a patch to implement
this. Unfortunately, it relies on having 64-bit types, which not every
platform we want to support has; thus it doubles the amount of memory
taken up by the scrollback, which we don't think this feature is
worth. Any patch we're likely to accept will need to deal with
<a href="compressed-scrollback.html">`compressed-scrollback'</a> first.
