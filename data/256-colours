Summary: Support for more colours
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: tricky
Depends: compressed-scrollback
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>It's been suggested that PuTTY could usefully support xterm's 256-colour
mode.  This would involve having rather more storage for character attributes
than at present, which in the present (0.53) design of PuTTY would mean using
64 bits to store each character of scrollback, which is slightly ludicrous.
When we get around to redesigning the scrollback format so as not to use
so much memory, adding more attribute bits might become feasible.

<p>&lt;1042233614.1153.15.camel@evilmagic.org&gt; contains a patch to implement
this.
