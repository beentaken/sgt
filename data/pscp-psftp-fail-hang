<p>
PSCP and PSFTP on Windows can hang on exit in various failure situations.
Many of these involve the <tt>-batch</tt> option, which is embarrassing.
For example:

<ul>
<li>User aborts at host key verification (or <tt>-batch</tt> is specified,
which has the same effect).
<li><tt>-batch</tt> is specified and no non-interactive authentication
method is successful.
</ul>

<p>
Interestingly, Plink does not appear to hang in similar situations (and
nor does PuTTY proper).

<p>
PSCP/PSFTP do not hang in <em>all</em> failure situations -- for instance,
they appear not to hang when interactive password authentication fails.

<p>
Looking at when this crept in, it might be another side-effect of the
introduction of the <tt>winhandl.c</tt> mechanism.
