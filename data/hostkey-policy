Summary: Enhanced flexibility in SSH host key selection policy

<p>
PuTTY's SSH-2 host key selection policy currently involves a fixed
preference order of RSA then DSA. I occasionally think it would be
good to add a preference list to tweak the policy, either to put DSA
first (if you're really mad) or to move DSA to below the "warn below
this line" line.

<p>
When there's a choice of host keys available for a host, perhaps
PuTTY should adjust its stated preferences so that the ones it
already has cached come first. Need to think about that a bit. At
the very least, when a new host key prompt is given, PuTTY should
mention if it already has host keys for a host in other formats -
particularly important when the <a href="ssh2-default.html">default
protocol changes to SSH-2</a>, or a server that previously offered
DSS keys starts supporting RSA too.
