Summary: Port to Unix
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
It's currently being worked on. If you look at the nightly source
snapshots, you should find a <code>unix</code> subdirectory, which should
build you a Unix port of Plink, and also <code>pterm</code> - an
<code>xterm</code>-type program which supports the same terminal emulation
as PuTTY.

<p>
You can also build a Unix port of PuTTY itself. This isn't as useful a
thing on Unix as it is on Windows; its major value is as a pathfinding
effort for other ports. If anyone really has a use for it, we'd be
interested to know why :-)

<p>
We don't currently have ports of any other PuTTY utilities.
