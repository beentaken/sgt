<p>
Both Windows and Unix PuTTY can now use fonts which are not internally
marked as monospaced.

<p>
This allows use of fonts which are designed for a fixed-width grid but
do not declare themselves as monospaced, such as
<a href="http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html">Unifont</a> or
<a href="http://www.fixedsysexcelsior.com/">Fixedsys Excelsior</a>.

<p>
If you <a href="http://xkcd.com/840/">really want to</a>, it's also
possible to use a non-monospaced font, although the result may not
look very good.
