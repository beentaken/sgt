Summary: Support for Right Alt on keyboards which don't call it AltGr
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-Type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Users from countries (is it <em>only</em> the US?) that don't need
the AltGr key might like to have an option that makes it work the
same way as the left Alt key.

<p>
This would be easy to implement by means of a configuration option,
but it would be nicer if we could somehow detect this property of
the active keymap and automatically switch between that key being
Right Alt and being AltGr.
