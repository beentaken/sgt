<p>
Long lines in PuTTY SSH-2 private key (.PPK) files could cause a
one-byte buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash. ("Long" here
means header values or other lines of 128 characters or more.)

<p>
In practice, this is most likely to occur if a very long comment field
is specified - I don't think there are any other circumstances under
which PuTTYgen will generate keys with lines that long.

<p>
Although this fault has been present ever since SSH-2 public-key
support was added to PuTTY, the report that led to its discovery
indicated that it only failed in 0.57. This may be down to a change in
the compiler version we used between 0.56 and 0.57.

<p>
Until the next release, if you want to continue to use release
versions of the PuTTY tools, a workaround is to load any affected key
into a snapshot version of PuTTYgen, trim the key comment, and then
save the key back out - it should then work with 0.57 tools. (The key
format hasn't changed since 0.57.)
