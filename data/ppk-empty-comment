Summary: Trouble with empty PPK key comments
Class: bug
Difficulty: fun
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.53b
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Certain forms of empty key comment in PPK files can cause PuTTY to
throw an assertion failure (terminal.c, line 3769, len &gt; 0 for
0.53b) (and possibly crash?). Apparently such files can be generated
by PuTTYgen.
