<p>
Certain forms of empty key comment in PPK files can cause PuTTY to
throw an assertion failure (terminal.c, line 3769, len &gt; 0 for
0.53b) (and possibly crash?). Apparently such files can be generated
by PuTTYgen.

<p>
<em>Update (JTN):</em> I've reproduced this with PuTTY and PuTTYgen
2003-06-29, connecting to "SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.4p1 Debian 1:3.4p1-1"
with SSH-2 and a passphrase'd RSA2 key which was configured on the
server. No crash. The comment part of the PPK file looks like:

<p><pre>0030                         43 6f 6d 6d 65 6e 74 3a           Comment:
0040 20 0d 0a                                           ..             </pre>

<p>
<em>Update:</em> I've added robustness improvements to everything
lurking behind <code>from_backend()</code>, and removed the assertions,
so this should be fixed now.
