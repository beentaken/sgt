Summary: Increase space allocated to auto-login username
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: fun
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Trivial fix: PuTTY truncates the `auto-login username' field to about
32 characters. Some sites have taken to allocating usernames of the
form <tt>username@verrylongdomainname.org</tt>, so we've received some
requests to increase this.
