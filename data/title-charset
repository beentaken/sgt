Summary: Window title escape sequences not interpreted in line charset
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>PuTTY does not display unicode characters correctly in the title bar.
When charset is set to UTF-8 from PuTTY and locales on the remote
computer are en_US.UTF-8, unicode characters are shown as they vere
latin chars.

<p>Also reported to Ubuntu as <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/putty/+bug/48781">bug 48781</a>, where it's suggested that
<a href="port-unix-gtk2.html">using GTK2</a> will
help.
