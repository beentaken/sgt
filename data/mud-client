Summary: MUD-client-like features

<p>
We occasionally get asked for clients useful for accessing MUDs - most
frequently, a separate text box for input below the main output
window, but also things like command history, triggers and so on.

<p>
We've no plans to turn PuTTY into a MUD client. You'd be better off
with specialist MUD client software (perhaps something like
<a href="http://www.muq.org/~hawkeye/tf/">TinyFugue</a> on a server
which you then use PuTTY to access).

<p>
Someone has taken bits of PuTTY and bits of other things to create a
thing called <a href="http://www.elvenrunes.com/powtty/">PowTTY</a>.
We know nothing about it, but it may be relevant.
