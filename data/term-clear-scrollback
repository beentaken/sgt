Summary: Server-controlled clearing of the scrollback

<p>
It would sometimes be nice to be able to clear PuTTY's scrollback from
the server (via an escape sequence). Example applications:
<ul>
<li>Terminal locking software (e.g. <tt>screen</tt>'s C-a C-x) could
issue this escape sequence.</li>
<li>If a lot of output is generated it makes use of the scrollback as
a poor man's <tt>less</tt> easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recent versions of <code>xterm</code> use an extension to ED to do
this, in the form of CSI <code>3</code> <code>J</code>.  We could do
the same.
<ul>
<li>For avoidance of doubt, this sequence <em>only</em> clears the
scrollback in xterm - it doesn't have any other effect.
(It was added to Thomas Dickey's <code>xterm</code> in
<a href="http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.log.html#xterm_107">patch 107</a>;
it is documented in <code>ctlseqs.ms</code> as "Erase Saved Lines
(xterm)".)
</ul>

<p>
It's been suggested that screen clears could do this. If so, it would
have to be configurable, and disabled by default.
