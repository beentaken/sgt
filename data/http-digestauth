Summary: PuTTY should support HTTP Digest authentication for proxies
Class: wish

Currently, when using HTTP proxies, PuTTY only supports HTTP Basic
authentication, which involves sending the user's password over the
network in cleartext, which is Bad.
HTTP Digest authentication is marginally more secure, and not
ludicrously complex, so PuTTY should probably support it.

Do we need to worry about whether this capability ends up in PuTTYtel?
