Summary: Opaque resizes under NT cause trouble
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Opaque resizes under NT cause trouble when the user changes their
mind and carefully drags the window back to the way it started out:
the contents of the screen have been trashed and no resize event is
sent to the server. Perhaps redisplay during resizing should be
reimplemented in a way that doesn't change the terminal buffer's
size at all.
