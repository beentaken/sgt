Summary: PuTTY mishandles machines with multiple addresses

<p>At present, if a host has multiple addresses, PuTTY merely connects to the
first one it gets.  This is arguably incorrect behaviour, and PuTTY should
try each address in turn until it gets one that works.  My feeling is that a
Socket_Addr should be able to contain multiple addresses, and sk_new should
handle the retries, but I haven't thought out how proxying would work.

<p><a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1123.txt">RFC 1123</a>
has this to say on the subject:

<blockquote>
<p>   When the remote host is multihomed, the name-to-address
      translation will return a list of alternative IP addresses.  As
      specified in Section 6.1.3.4, this list should be in order of
      decreasing preference.  Application protocol implementations
      SHOULD be prepared to try multiple addresses from the list until
      success is obtained.  More specific requirements for SMTP are
      given in Section 5.3.4.

<b>SGT, 2005-01-16</b>: This is much more important in an
IPv6-supporting world, since there's the possibility that your DNS
lookup will return you an IPv6 and an IPv4 address in that order,
and if you can't route to the former then you <em>must</em> fall
back to the latter or else the introduction of IPv6 support has made
matters worse for you. Hence, done.
