Summary: Data received from local proxy commands tagged as TCP Urgent (breaks telnet)

<p>
When I implemented the
<a href="proxy-command.html">proxy-command</a> feature, I accidentally
set it up so that all data received from a local proxy subprocess (on
both Unix and Windows) was tagged as TCP Urgent.

<p>
This made no difference to SSH (which is how I didn't notice), but it
completely breaks Telnet. Fixed in r8158.
