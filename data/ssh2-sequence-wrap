<i>et al</i></a> note that if the sequence number for SSH2 MACs repeats
itself without an intervening rekey, all sorts of attacks become possible.
If PuTTY were particularly paranoid, it could force a re-key before this
happens, and even kill the connection if the sequence number did wrap around.
More polite would probably be a note in the documentation that turning off
traffic-based re-keying is a very bad idea and to accept the
worse-than-it-could-be security of connections to servers that can't re-key.
