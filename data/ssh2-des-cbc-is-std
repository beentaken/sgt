<p>According to
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-assignednumbers-04.txt">
draft-ietf-secsh-assignednumbers-04.txt</a>, "des-cbc" is one of the
assigned cipher names for SSH-2.  PuTTY currently describes it (in the
configuration box, the documentation, and comments in sshdes.c) as
non-standard.

<p>
OSD: toned down "non-standard" to "legacy", which I claim fixes this.
