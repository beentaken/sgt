<p>According to
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-assignednumbers-01.txt">
draft-ietf-secsh-assignednumbers-01.txt</a>, "des-cbc" is one of the
assigned cipher names for SSH2.  PuTTY currently describes it (in the
configuration box, the documentation, and comments in sshdes.c) as
non-standard.

<p>
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-assignednumbers-01.txt">
draft-ietf-secsh-assignednumbers-01.txt</a> is, however, incorrect in
this area, since it claims:
<blockquote>
   This document defines the initial state of the IANA assigned numbers
   for the SSH protocol as defined in [SSH-ARCH], [SSH-TRANS], [SSH-CONNECT],
   [SSH-USERAUTH].  This document does not define any new
   protocols or any number ranges not already defined in the above
   referenced documents.
</blockquote>
<p>"des-cbc" is not defined in any of those referenced documents.
