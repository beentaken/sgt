Summary: PuTTY violates RFC-854 option-loop prevention

RFC 854 includes the following rule to prevent option-negotiation loops:

      b. If a party receives what appears to be a request to enter some
      mode it is already in, the request should not be acknowledged.
      This non-response is essential to prevent endless loops in the
      negotiation.  It is required that a response be sent to requests
      for a change of mode -- even if the mode is not changed.

PuTTY gets this wrong for options that it doesn't support.
