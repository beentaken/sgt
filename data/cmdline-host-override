Summary: -load overrides a host name specified on the command line

<p>
If both <code>-load</code> and a hostname are specified on PuTTY's command
line, the hostname from the saved session takes precedence, which it
shouldn't.  This is because bare hostnames aren't passed through
<code>cmdline_process_param()</code> in the same way that (e.g.) bare port
numbers are, so they end up being trampled by
<code>cmdline_process_saved()</code>.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2003-03-22</b>: Well, <code>-load</code> is now processed
immediately rather than being deferred until
<code>cmdline_process_saved()</code>. This should eliminate this
sort of bug completely. However, the effect on Plink host names
isn't exactly what I stated above; instead, specifying a
<code>-load</code> option that mentions a host name actually
<em>prevents</em> Plink from looking for an explicit host name. The
upshot of this is that the command <code>plink -load session
host</code> will connect to the host specified in the saved session,
and interpret "<code>host</code>" as the command to run.

<p>
It's possible that some people really do have a need to load a saved
session and override only its host name component, but I think this
behaviour is more generally useful. If anyone complains I can always
add an explicit <code>-host</code> command-line option.
