Summary: PuTTY interacts badly with Windows' automatic tiling

From an e-mail:

It would be nice if PuTTY worked better with Windows' taskbar's "Tile 
Windows Horizontally/Vertically" context menu option.

For simplicity let's say you have only two PuTTY windows open.  And you 
right click the task bar and choose "Tile Horizontally".  The PuTTY windows 
don't act the same as say, Notepad, would.  Their size doesn't change yet 
they are positioned properly (one at the top and the other halfway down the 
screen).

Try it with two Notepad windows (or pretty much any program) to see the 
difference.

I assume it's because of PuTTY's strict resizing limitation -- based on the 
font in the terminal window.
It would be great if window sizes were automatically resized to as be close 
as possible to what's requested of them by a system-wide "Tile 
Horizontally/Vertically" instruction.
