Suppose you run a server-side application which switches to the
alternate terminal screen. While running this application, you
decide you could do with some more vertical space, so you make the
window taller. A SIGWINCH is sent to the remote process and it
adjusts to the new screen size; no problem there.

<p>
Now, when you quit the application and the primary terminal screen
is restored, something weird seems to happen. It looks to me as if
the previous contents of the primary screen are restored somewhere
near the bottom of the now-taller window, while the cursor is
restored somewhere near the top.

<p>
I'm not entirely sure how this <em>should</em> be handled - for
instance, there's an argument in favour of pulling lines out of the
scrollback and putting them back into the primary screen, as happens
when you resize without the alternate screen active. But certainly
it would be a good start for the cursor position to match up to the
screen contents!

Boulton which fixes this.
