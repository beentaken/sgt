<p>
Several people have asked for support for the implementation of
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/products/securid/index.html">SecurID</a>
in ssh.com's server.

<p>
Unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, ssh.com have
chosen to define this as a private authentication method
`securid-1@ssh.com' (rather than using for instance
keyboard-interactive authentication). We haven't seen a spec for this
method, so can't implement it in PuTTY.
