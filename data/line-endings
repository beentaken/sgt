Summary: Line ending conversion in PSCP and PSFTP
Difficulty: tricky

<p>
Possibly line-end conversion in PSCP and PSFTP. An option to turn it
on, an option (enabled by default) to turn it off, and perhaps an
option to try to auto-detect whether to turn it on or not. (Anyone
know a good heuristic for distinguishing text from binary files?
infozip has one, as does less; anyone want to comment on which is
better or whether there are better still?)

<p>
Heuristics shouldn't now be needed at the protocol end for SFTP, as
<code>SSH_FXF_TEXT</code> has now been proposed in SFTP v4 (see
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-04.txt">draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-04</a>).
I don't know what implementations exist.

<p>
Should we require explicit triggering of this mechanism for local
files via a command/option, or should we have a "guess" mode? If the
latter, I think we should be able to spot and cope with Unix-style
files on a Windows system.
