<p>
The ability to specify the precise position on the screen you want
your PuTTY window to open at. This is clearly a very useful thing to
have, but it would be just as useful for all the <em>other</em>
Windows apps anyone uses. It shouldn't be the responsibility of
every single program to include a configuration option to specify
window position. Instead, it should be the responsibility of the
Windows system itself, or a third-party program, to remember where
you like individual programs to go.

One such program is

(shareware); another is

(also shareware). If anyone knows of a free (as in speech) one, I'd
like to hear about it.
