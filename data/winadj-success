<p>
We've had a few reports of SSH connections bombing out with the
following error message, reportedly under heavy load:

<pre>PuTTY Fatal Error

(X)  Disconnected: Received SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS for
     "winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org"

                      [   OK   ]</pre>

<p>
This message has only existed in PuTTY since the
<a href="flow-control.html">'flow-control'</a>
feature was implemented, which was after we released 0.60; so
<!-- XXX-REVIEW-BEFORE-RELEASE -->at the time of writing, only people
using development snapshots, or third-party code incorporating
development code, should be seeing this. We probably want to find out
what's going on before we make a release with this feature in.

<p>
On the face of it, it looks like the SSH server is incorrectly
responding to our unilaterally-defined channel request message with
SUCCESS, which it should never do since it's something we made up. 
(<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixF.html#sshnames-channel">Our documentation</a>
mandates a FAILURE response, but that's only a restatement of the
RFC 4254 requirement for a FAILURE response to requests that
aren't understood -- we don't expect any server to specifically
handle this message.)

<p>
However, perhaps we're getting confused about the mapping of requests
to responses, or something.
