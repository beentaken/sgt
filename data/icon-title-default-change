<p>
Separate window and icon titles don't make as much sense in the
post-Win95 world as in X11/Windows 3 style user interfaces. Judging by
the mail we get, the resulting behaviour seems to be surprising to a
fair few users. Perhaps we should turn off use of icon titles by
default.

In fixing this, I've changed the sense of the control in the Windows
UI - what was `Avoid ever using icon title' is now `Separate window
and icon titles'. Docs updated accordingly.
