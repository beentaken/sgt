Summary: Send keyboard input to multiple active sessions

<p>
A few people have asked us to implement a feature where multiple
sessions simultaneously take input from the keyboard. (Perhaps with a
separate window for input to all sessions, allowing input to
individual sessions too.) The usual reason cited is the need to
administer multiple similar systems (e.g., clusters).

<p>
(Apparently `Sun Cluster' implements something like this in
`ctelnet/estelnet').

<p>
We think that this is (a) a niche feature not worth taking up space in
everyone's PuTTY binaries for, and (b) better done by a separate
application. Outlined below is a design for a Windows application
which would do the job:

<blockquote><p>
If I'm the sort of user who wants to type the same text into multiple
windows, there's no real reason I might not want to type the same text
into a collection of windows that I <em>already</em> had on the
screen, or had not happened to start up from the same PuTTY command
line. Ideally I'd like to select any set of my existing windows and
type the same text into all of those. In fact, they probably wouldn't
all want to be PuTTYs - I can see clear uses for being able to select
a bunch of PuTTYs and a Notepad, so I can keep a log of what I typed
in a text file.

<p>
What I'm driving at is that I think this could be a useful piece of
functionality, but really it belongs in a separate input-duplicating
application which is independent of PuTTY. The way I see this
working is:

<ul>
<li>you'd start up this application, and it would contain (say) a
   list box which listed the windows it was currently targetting.

<li>there would also be an `Add Window' button; you'd press this,
   then select another top-level window (a PuTTY, or something
   else), and the title of that window would appear in the list.

<li>there'd be an actual input box, which you could select and then
   type text. Any text you typed into the input box would be sent to
   all the windows shown in the list.

<li>when a targetted application closed, the duplicator would notice
   and its title bar would vanish from the list.
</ul>

<p>
I think this application, as I've outlined it, would be far more
flexible and useful than putting the functionality directly into
PuTTY. Unfortunately, I don't think I've got the time to write it.

There are apparently Unix utilities called
<a href="http://www.stearns.org/fanout/README.html">fanout and fanterm</a>
which implement this style of thing.
