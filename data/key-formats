Summary: Support for OpenSSH and ssh.com SSH2 private key formats

<p>
Although PuTTY shares the same SSH1 private key file format as
OpenSSH and ssh.com's product, all the SSH2 formats are different.
Of course, we believe PuTTY's is the best, because it shows the
public key unencrypted (so it's easy to check by eye that a
particular private key matches a particular public key) and because
it's fully tamperproofed to protect against any attacks that involve
tampering with the key to reveal information about it.

<p>
However, a lot of people want to be able to use their OpenSSH or
ssh.com private keys (usually OpenSSH) with PuTTY. So we probably
need at least PuTTYgen to be able to load and save those formats. (I
think if we build the conversion capability into PuTTYgen, there
will be no need to bloat PuTTY itself with the same code.)

<p>
As of 2002-05-19, PuTTYgen supports import/export of both OpenSSH and
ssh.com key formats. We've still got a couple of outstanding problem
reports, though:

<ul>
<li>Exporting OpenSSH key (RSA), passphrase appears to be exported
incorrectly.
<br><tt>15605.12548.474812.778142@yakisoba.forte-intl.com</tt>
<li>2002-06-05, importing OpenSSH DSA key, crash after entering
passphrase (includes offending key and crash dump).
<br><tt>uit4ooqxe.fsf@MtDiablo.com</tt>
</ul>

<p>
SGT, 2002-06-15: both those problems believed identified and fixed.
Fixes not yet confirmed by original bug reporters.
