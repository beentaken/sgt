Summary: "unexpected packet type 91" with tunnel open during connection setup

<pre>Report of message "Unexpected response to shell/command request:
packet type 91" - seems to be correlated with seeing "Opening
forwarded connection" before "Allocated pty" in Event log.

Sounds to me like the connection setup code is insufficiently able to
cope with asynchrony. PuTTY certainly shouldn't be sending CHANNEL_OPEN
then being offended by the resulting CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION.

Reproduced using netcat: "nc -vvvvvv localhost 10119" runned many times
while PuTTY is connecting.

Previous report:
----------
PuTTY Release 0.53b
Windows 95 B
SSH2
Server version: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.4p1

The problem/symptom: PuTTY shows a message box with "Unexpected response to
shell/command request: packet type 91" and goes into inactive mode where
port forwarding isn't possible (I guess it's line 5236 in ssh.c).

How to reproduce: Have PuTTY forward a local port to a machine on the other
end. Try to use the forwarded port while starting PuTTY and connecting to
the remote host.

I have the problem with an internal news server on my university which I
read through an SSH forwarded port using Forte Agent that I tell to fetch
news before PuTTY is connected. Forte Agent waits 1 second between retries.

[...]

It seems PuTTY sends an SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN interleaved with other
packets and then gets confused when it sees the reply
SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION.

I should probably also note that the problem is periodic, and whenever I
have seen the problem and the event log (5 times or so) it has had "Opening
forwarded connection to news.example.com:119" just before "Allocated pty".

Also I have found netcat better to provoke the error by trying "nc -vvv
localhost 10119" just before running "C:\Programmer\putty\putty.exe -load
ask" in another prompt.
