Summary: SSH-2 CTR modes

The Internet Draft, draft-ietf-secsh-newmodes-03.txt,
specifies a new symmetric-encryption mode for SSH that doesn't suffer
from the flaws described in ssh2-cbc-weakness.  The AES modes are now
implemented in PuTTY (as of 2005-04-07), but 3des-ctr and blowfish-ctr
await successful interoperability testing.
