Summary: PuTTY could use RSA keys held on smartcards

<p>It's been suggested that PuTTY could use RSA keys held on a smartcard for
authentication.  This would require interfacing with smartcard APIs and
suchlike, and might be an application for the <a href="mdpi.html">MDPI</a>.

<p>Alternatively, it might be better to integrate smartcard support into
an SSH agent, either as part of Pageant or as a plug-in replacement for it.
After all, the purpose of a smartcard is to generate cryptographic signatures
on demand, which is what an SSH agent does too.

<p>Some patches we've seen:
<ul>
<li><tt>&lt;200409231510.55383.kstef@mtppi.org&gt;
<br>Patches against PuTTY/Pageant 0.55 to use PKCS#11 libraries (tested with 
<a href="http://www.opensc.org/">OpenSC</a>)
<li>These patches can be found in
<a href="http://www.opensc.org/files/contrib/">opensc.org's contrib directory</a>.
<li><tt>&lt;300242548@web.de&gt;
<br>Patch with extended key file format that uses external (PuTTY-specific?)
DLL
<br>A compiled binary called PuTTYcard can <em>also</em> be found in
<a href="http://www.opensc.org/files/contrib/">opensc.org's contrib directory</a>,
although confusingly it apparently doesn't <em>use</em> OpenSC.
