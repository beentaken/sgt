Summary: PuTTY could use RSA keys held on smartcards
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: taxing
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>It's been suggested that PuTTY could use RSA keys held on a smartcard for
authentication.  This would require interfacing with smartcard APIs and
suchlike, and might be an application for the <a href="mdpi.html">MDPI</a>.

<p>Alternatively, it might be better to integrate smartcard support into
an SSH agent, either as part of Pageant or as a plug-in replacement for it.
After all, the purpose of a smartcard is to generate cryptographic signatures
on demand, which is what an SSH agent does too.

<p>Some patches we've seen (links are on our
<a href="../links.html">Links page</a>):
<ul>
<li><tt>&lt;200409231510.55383.kstef@mtppi.org&gt;</tt>
<br>Patches against PuTTY/Pageant 0.55 to use PKCS#11 libraries (tested with 
<a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/">OpenSC</a>)
<br>These patches can be found in
<a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/files/contrib/">opensc-project.org's contrib directory</a>.
There is a packaged version called the Smart Card Bundle.
<li><tt>&lt;300242548@web.de&gt;</tt>
<br>Patch with extended key file format that uses external (PuTTY-specific?)
DLL
<br>A compiled binary called PuTTYcard can <em>also</em> be found in
<a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/files/contrib/">opensc-project.org's contrib directory</a>,
although confusingly it apparently doesn't <em>use</em> OpenSC.
<li><tt>&lt;1673247798@web.de&gt;</tt>
<br>... which was replaced by a directly smartcard-enabled Pageant.
<li>PuTTY SC uses PKCS#11.
</ul>
