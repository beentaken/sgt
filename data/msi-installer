<p>
A few people have expressed a desire for an MSI-based Windows
installer for PuTTY. Apparently MSI is easier/possible
to deploy via various software deployment
mechanisms (Group Policy, SMS, Active Directory), compared to our
current <a href="http://www.innosetup.com/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a>
installer.

<p>
Apparently <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/">WiX</a> is a free
thing that will create MSI-based installers.
<a href="http://www.installsite.org/pages/en/msi/authoring.htm">This page</a>
lists some others.
