<p>Fatal error handling is patchy and flaky. It's very easy to throw a
fatal error, put up a message box, and then receive a Windows
message containing yet more socket data. The MessageBox message loop
then dispatches that message automatically and the back end is
called reentrantly. Chaos ensues. Solution: the fatal error
behaviour should be much more robust. Close <em>all</em> sockets the
instant a fatal error occurs; also set some global flags that
prevent action messages from having any back end effect.
