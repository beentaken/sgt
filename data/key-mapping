Summary: Generic key mapping facility

<p>
We've resisted introducing generalised key remapping for some time,
on the grounds that it's just too horrible, and also on the grounds
that if we introduce a scripting language then key remapping could
appear as a side benefit of that.

<p>
However, since scripting now looks likely to be a DLL plugin if
it even happens at all, and since more and more people have written
to tell us that there are more configurations in use for the
<a href="function-keys.html">function keys</a> than we could possibly have dreamed of, I think we're
eventually going to have to get round to doing a proper key
remapping facility.

<p>
The major difficulty in this is that we want PuTTY to remain
portable to other operating systems. So we're somehow going to have
to split the keyboard processing down the middle, so that we have a
platform-dependent half which converts Windows keyboard messages
into a set of PuTTY standard key and modifier names, and then a
platform-generic half which maps our standard key names into actual
character sequences to be sent to the host.
(See <a href="portable-keyboard.html">portable-keyboard</a> for
further discussion of this problem.)

<b>SGT, 2006-05-24</b>: A user suggests that it would be nice when
using some server-side applications (<code>irssi</code> in
particular) to be able to configure the mouse scroll wheel to send
scroll-up and scroll-down keypresses to the server. This seems to me
to be best implemented by having a general key remapping layer and
making it able to remap mouse events as well as key events. (This
would also allow users to disable or reconfigure the normal mouse
button behaviour as well if they disliked the default.)
