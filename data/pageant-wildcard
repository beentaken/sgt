Summary: Accept wildcards on Pageant command line
Difficulty: fun

It's been suggested that Pageant's command-line handling (on Windows) should
include the usual wildcard expansion.  This would allow for doing something
like "pageant keys/*.ppk" at login to load all the user's keys at once at
login.  This seems like a good idea.
