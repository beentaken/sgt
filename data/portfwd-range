Summary: Allow port ranges in tunnel UI
Difficulty: fun

<p>
We've had a couple of requests for the port forwarding UI to allow
ranges of ports (e.g., source port 5000-5030, destination
192.168.0.10:5000-5030).

<p>
This is slightly more necessary than it could be because of the
limitations on the number of forwarded ports (see 
<a href="portfwd-space.html">`portfwd-space'</a>).
