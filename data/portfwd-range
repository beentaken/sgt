Summary: Allow port ranges in tunnel UI
Difficulty: fun

<p>
We've had a couple of requests for the port forwarding UI to allow
ranges of ports (e.g., source port 5000-5030, destination
192.168.0.10:5000-5030).

<p>
Another suggestion is a port of '*' for unrestricted forwarding to a
given host. (Although, if you're heading in this direction, you might
want to investigate
<a href="portfwd-dynamic.html">dynamic port forwarding</a>.)

<p>
We might want to be cautious about allowing this for remote-to-local
forwarding, as we'd have to send a request for every port in the range
at startup. (I think we'd certainly disallow '*'!)

<p>
This is slightly more necessary than it could be because of the
limitations on the number of forwarded ports (see 
<a href="portfwd-space.html">`portfwd-space'</a>).
