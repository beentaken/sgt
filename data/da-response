At present, PuTTY's default response to DA (CSI c) is CSI ? 6 c, which
denotes a VT102.  This is slightly inconsistent with xterm, which returns
CSI ? 1 ; 2 c -- a VT100 with AVO.  Since PuTTY supports quite a few VT400
options, I suspect it would be more sensible for it to return something
in the 6x range, perhaps based on the current compatibility level set
by DECSCL.  Maybe it should even be configurable -- it is on a VT420.
