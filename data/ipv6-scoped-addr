Summary: On Windows, IPv6 scoped addresses don't work

It's been reported that IPv6 scoped addresses (as defined in RFC4007), such as
fe80::200:e2ff:fe65:9ce%4, don't work correctly on Windows XP Home + XP2.
The error is "Network error: No route to host".
SecureCRT does work, which suggests that we might just need to invoke
getaddrinfo() differently.  Scoped addresses work on Unix (NetBSD at least).
