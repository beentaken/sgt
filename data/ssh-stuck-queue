Summary: SSH data can get stuck in a queue if session throttled
Present-in: 0.58
Class: bug

<p>
If an SSH connection is throttled ("frozen"), incoming data can end up
stuck in <code>ssh-&gt;queued_incoming_data</code> and not processed
until more data arrives from the network (or ever, if the socket has
closed in the meantime), since that buffer is only examined when new
data arrives. In general, queued data may be being processed rather
later than it could be.

<p>
For instance, <tt>cat</tt>'ing a large text file might hang, only to
resume when a key is pressed (which will result in outgoing and then
incoming traffic).

<p>
There's been a report that this shows up in real life when receiving
lots of data down an SSH-1 connection, where <code>ssh1_throttle()</code>
is called.

<p>
Another likely report of this problem:

<p>
<code>ssh_set_frozen()</code> should probably signal something, but
I'm not sure enough of the control flow to know quite what.
