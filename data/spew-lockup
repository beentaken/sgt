<p>
If the remote server floods us with terminal data enthusiastically
enough, it can saturate us with input data, completely locking out the
local GUI (at least on Windows). The appearance is that PuTTY appears
to hang: it consumes as much CPU as it can, the terminal display does
not update, and the GUI (keyboard, menus etc) is unresponsive. If and
when the stream of data abates, PuTTY becomes responsive again.

<p>
This crept in somewhere between 0.57 and 0.58.

I (JTN) seem to recall noticing that some code which periodically gave
the GUI a chance to update disappeared in some upheaval or
other, but I didn't follow it up at the time and haven't got round
to digging it up again.

<b>SGT, 2007-01-07</b>: I think this came in at r4906, when I
removed the <code>pending_netevent</code> mechanism in the process
of setting up the new timing infrastructure. Putting it back in
seems to solve it.
