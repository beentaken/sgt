Summary: We should provide IPv6-enabled binaries.

<p>
PuTTY has IPv6 support in the codebase, but it's not compiled in to
the binaries we release. We don't currently have the headers and
libraries needed to compile with IPv6 support, and haven't yet got
round to getting hold of them. (Therefore, we don't test the IPv6
support, either.)  It's suggested that we could get them
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/msripv6/msripv6.htm">here</a>.

<p>
In the meantime,
<a href="http://unfix.org/projects/ipv6/">unfix.org</a> makes
available some binaries compiled with -DIPV6. But note that we haven't
personally checked them, and can't vouch for their trustworthiness.
