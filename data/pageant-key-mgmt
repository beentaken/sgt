Summary: Better key management in Pageant

Pageant should offer a wider range of key management options.

For a start, it should be possible to load a key but defer
decrypting it. Pageant would report the existence of the key, but
only when it was first actually used would it bother asking for the
passphrase. Then the key would be decrypted, and subsequent requests
could be fulfilled immediately.

Once that's possible, it would also allow a key to expire after
being present for a certain time (or perhaps after being unused for
a certain time).

It might be useful for Pageant to be able to remember which keys it
has loaded and reload them automatically on restart (though, again,
this is probably only useful once we can defer decryption).

It might be handy to have special command-line options for Pageant
which would cause to start up, send commands to the primary Pageant,
and shut down again. We can already add keys to the primary Pageant,
but it might be good to be able to delete keys or shut it down as
well.
