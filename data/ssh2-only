Currently, PuTTY's choice of SSH protocol can only be expressed as a
preference. If you ask for an SSH2 connection and only SSH1 is
available, or vice versa, PuTTY will fall back to whatever it can
use.

For security reasons we should also allow the user to specify "SSH2
or nothing", so that if PuTTY couldn't make an SSH2 connection it
would give up rather than fall back to SSH1. For symmetry, we should
also support "SSH1 or nothing", though that seems less obviously
useful.
