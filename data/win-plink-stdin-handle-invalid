<p>
The "Unable to read from standard input" message is still with us;
the reports we're getting from versions including the diagnostics
added while investigating
<a href="win-plink-stdin-eof.html">win-plink-stdin-eof</a> say
"The handle is invalid".

<p>
All reports so far occur when Plink is run by some other program,
and cannot be reproduced when the same command is run from the
Windows command-line or Cygwin.
