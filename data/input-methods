Support for various international input methods. There's been a
report from the Netherlands of an "international keyboard driver"
which allows you to enter, for example, an "&Euml;" just by typing a
double quote and then an E. I believe there are also Eastern input
mechanisms we don't handle sensibly. Somebody who knows about this
stuff will have to do it for me and probably explain it to me as
well, because I just don't know enough about internationalisation.
