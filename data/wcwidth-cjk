<p>
In <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c">Markus
Kuhn's <tt>wcwidth.c</tt></a>, which PuTTY uses, there is a variant of
<code>wcwidth()</code> that treats certain characters of ambiguous
width as being double-width, rather than single-width as the default
version does.

<p>
Currently the variant version is commented out and not used. We've had
a few requests to add an option to use this variant, though.
