<p>
Extra back end to connect to a serial port instead of a Telnet or SSH
connection.

<p>
Need to think about how this fits into our UI - unlike every other
backend so far, serial connections have neither hostname nor port,
and other connections don't have stop bits and guff like that.

<p>
Workaround: for NT-class systems, you could use

to turn the serial connection into a telnet connection.
