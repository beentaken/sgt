Summary: Requests to Pageant should be asynchronous
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/plain

Currently, when PuTTY makes a request to Pageant, it waits in a
tight loop for the answer. Really it should be able to answer
Windows messages and do other housekeeping tasks while it's waiting
for the answer. This would enable Pageant to do a variety of
time-consuming things in the course of answering a request.
