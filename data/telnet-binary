<p>
PuTTY doesn't support the TELNET
<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc856.txt">BINARY</a> option.
<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1123.txt">RFC 1123</a>
(section 3.3.3)
states that TELNET implementations MUST support it, so its absence is
a bug.

<p>
SGT, 2002-12-19: I've checked in an implementation which should
appear in 2002-12-20 and beyond.
