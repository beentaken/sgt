<p>The addition of <a href="ssh2-rsa-kex.html">ssh2-rsa-kex</a> has caused
a problem with the KEX algorithm preference list, in that while the new
default list puts RSA ahead of WARN, loading a saved session from an older
PuTTY version that didn't support RSA KEX will leave RSA after warn.
This is an inherent consequence of the way <tt>gprefs()</tt> works.

<p>Fixing the problem isn't trivial.  In this case, it would probably
be reasonable to promote RSA to just above WARN if it's absent, but there
probably isn't a suitable general rule.  Another approach would be to
scrap the preference lists and have a better <a href="cipher-selection.html">
cipher selection</a> mechanism.
