<p>
Perhaps we should display the "bubble-babble" encoding for host key
fingerprints, as well as the hexadecimal one, since several other
implementations support it.

<p>
Bubble-babble is specified in an expired Internet-Draft
(draft-huima-babble-01), archived on the IETF SECSH
<a href="ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive/secsh/2001-08.mail">mailing list</a>.
There are various implementations around, such as
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~btrott/Digest-BubbleBabble-0.01/BubbleBabble.pm">Digest::BubbleBabble.pm</a>.

<p>
Should we display both formats always, or let it be configurable? If
the latter, per-session, or global?
