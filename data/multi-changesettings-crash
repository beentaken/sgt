summary: Multiple Change Settings dialogues cause crash

If you open multiple simultaneous Change Settings dialogue boxes from
the same PuTTY session, PuTTY crashes when you close one of them.

We should restrict Change Settings so you can only have one at a time!

As of 2005-03-16, this should be the case in both the Unix and Windows
ports.  In neither case is this done particularly elegantly; we should
(but don't) arrange to give focus to an existing Change Settings
window if the menu item is reselected.
