Summary: Better command line options

<p> The PuTTY tools have a pathetic set of command-line options.
Among the things we should support but don't are:

<ul>
<li>
Unified command-line handling between all the tools, including the
GUI ones. (This is moderately tricky in itself, because we'd have to
split up the single command line received by WinMain() into argc and
argv.)
<li>
Command-line control of at least ciphers, SSH protocol, compression,
port forwarding, and public-key authentication. Perhaps more.
<li>
As many of these options as possible should be command-line
compatible with OpenSSH's corresponding options. The last thing we
want to do is make life deliberately harder for people.
<li>
As a final fallback, ability to tweak any option via something like
OpenSSH's `-o Name=Value' option. Need to think about how to deal
with complex options like colour selection. Also, some of the existing
names for options in the Registry are inappropriate - e.g., 
`LinuxFunctionKeys'. Seems dependent on wishlist item `config-locations'.
</ul>
