Summary: Better handling of literal IPv6 addresses
Class: bug
Difficulty: fun
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.60
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
While PuTTY has had IPv6 support since 0.58, its handling of IPv6
literal addresses (e.g., <tt>::1</tt>) still leaves something to be
desired. In particular, there are various places where hostnames form
part of a colon-delimited syntax (e.g., port-forwarding
configuration); this interacts badly with IPv6 addresses containing
colons.

<p>
PuTTY should consistently accept IPv6 literals in the square-bracket
notation defined for URLs
(in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC3986</a>)
wherever it accepts a hostname.
