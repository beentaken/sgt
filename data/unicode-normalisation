Summary: Apply Unicode normalisation to combining characters
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: tricky
Depends: mdpi

<p>
The bug
<a href="unicode-combining.html">unicode-combining</a>
is marked as fixed. However, it mentioned that the sequence of code
points occupying a character cell ought to be maintained in Normalisation
Form C (see
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/">UAX #15</a>).
This has not yet been done, although combining character support is
complete in all other respects.

<p>
I was originally convinced of the need for normalisation simply
because it was what <code>xterm</code> did. I'm now less certain,
and I wonder if it ought to be configurable (and if so whether the
particular normalisation form in use ought to be configurable too).

<p>
Regardless, this is a big job, and in particular it will require
considerable code size increase since normalisation is a job needing
large tables. Therefore, I fear it will have to wait until we have
<a href="mdpi.html">mdpi</a>
done.
