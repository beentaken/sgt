<p>
When requesting X11 forwarding from an SSH server, PuTTY currently always
requests a default screen number of 0.  This is less than optimal for users
of multiple-screen X servers, who might prefer a different default.
PuTTY should probably pull the screen number off the end of cfg.x11_display
and use that.
