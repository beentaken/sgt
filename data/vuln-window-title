<p>
It's been <a href="http://www.digitaldefense.net/labs/papers/Termulation.txt">
suggested</a> that window-title reports might be a bad idea, since they
allow anyone who can generate arbitrary output to a terminal to cause
almost-arbitrary input from it.  The various other terminal reports
supported by PuTTY are less of a problem because their formats are rather
more constrained.

<p>
PuTTY should probably make window-title reporting support optional and have
it default to off.
