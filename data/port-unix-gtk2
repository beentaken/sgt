Summary: Port to Gtk+-2 toolkit on Unix
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low
Fixed-in: r8040 2008-06-06

Currently, the Unix port of PuTTY uses the Gtk+-1.2 UI toolkit. It
would be nice if it could also support Gtk+-2.

We would require that the source still be compilable against Gtk+-1.2.

We've also been working on this; see
svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty-gtk2 .

Update: this is now complete and has been merged onto the trunk, and
is thus included in our snapshot releases and will be in the next
proper release. Please try it.
