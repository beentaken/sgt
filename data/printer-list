<p>
The magic we use to get a drop-down list of printers for our raw ANSI
printing support doesn't work too well on all systems. You can still
type a printer name into the combo box and expect it to work. We've
received various suggested fixes, but we haven't understood / tested
them thoroughly yet.

(While we're looking at this, it's been pointed out that having an
option to go with the Windows default printer would be nice.)
