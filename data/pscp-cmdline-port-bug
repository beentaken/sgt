<p>
There have been a lot of reports that the <tt>-P port</tt>
command-line argument is ignored in PSCP (and PSFTP) 0.53 (with it
instead using port 22 regardless).

<p>
This occurs whenever the protocol is not explicitly set to SSH in a
saved session. For most people, the likely cause is use of a hostname
which doesn't correspond to a saved session; PSCP picks up the Default
Settings, which currently have a factory default protocol of Telnet.

<p>
Workarounds are therefore to either create a saved session for the
relevant host or to set up SSH as the default protocol in Default
Settings. Additionally, this should be fixed in the development
snapshots.
