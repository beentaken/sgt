Summary: Make UTF-8 the default line character set
Class: wish

It's 2013. Every major current Linux distribution defaults to emitting UTF-8
in terminals. It's time for our default to change from ISO-8859-x.

(The previous default wasn't always ISO-8859-1, although that's what many
people got. On Windows, we picked a line character set -- usually ISO-8859-x --
that vaguely resembled the local Win125x codepage, for want of a better
idea. On Unix, we looked at the selected font and promoted its declared
character set, if any, to the line character set -- this option is still
available via "Use font encoding".)
