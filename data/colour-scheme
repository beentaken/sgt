Summary: Predefined colour schemes
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low
Class: wish

A couple of people would like to have a bunch of pre-defined colour schemes
shipped with PuTTY and some means of switching between them.  One person
specifically requested on where blue and red are lighter than the default to
make them more readable on a black background.

It's not entirely clear to me why colours are different from any other
configuration option in this regard, though I suppose the fact that all the
colour settings go together might have something to do with it.
