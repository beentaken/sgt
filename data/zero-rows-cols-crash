Secondly I wanted to report a very minor bug in putty. If you have a 
logged in session (SSH to a Linux box in this case) and you choose 
"change settings.." from the right click menu on putty and then change 
the window size to 0 Rows 0 Columns putty will crash. As it crashes it 
pops up a modal OK error message box with the title 'Putty Fatal Error' 
and the text 'Out of Memory'. Once you click OK the putty window closes.

BJH: I've tested this with Unix PuTTY, and the problem doesn't arise because
my window manager limits how small the window can get.
