Summary: PuTTY's placement of PUTTY.RND is non-optimal on Windows
Class: semi-bug

<p>
PuTTY attempts to store its random number seed file
<code>PUTTY.RND</code> in a sensible place (such as the user's home
directory), as described in the <a href="../faq.html#faq-settings">FAQ</a>.

<p>
However, we've had various reports that this isn't working as
designed, and that <code>PUTTY.RND</code> is ending up in
<code>C:\</code>. This has been reported on Windows 2000 and XP.

<p>
Suggested alternative from
<code>001201c32fd3$8c5484a0$bc1eb440@hyperwolf</code>: use one of the
paths returned by <code>SHGetFolderPath</code> (requires some faffing
wrt old Windows versions - full horrors in
<code>200310180552.h9I5qHZ21748@cs.auckland.ac.nz</code>).

<p>
(If this is fixed, perhaps we should continue to support
<em>reading</em> the files from their old locations.)

<p>
<em>Update, 2006-11-08:</em> it's been suggested that this might stop
PuTTY running as a standard user in Windows Vista. Bumped priority.
