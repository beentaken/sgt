<p>
An option to automatically accept all SSH host keys. For some reason
lots of people seem to think this would be a really useful feature.
I'm sure it would be very convenient, but at the expense of
security! The whole point of host keys is that they're the
<em>only</em> guarantee you have that your connection hasn't been
hijacked by an active attacker between you and the server, and that
your data isn't being decrypted by the attacker and re-encrypted. If
you want to schedule an automated batch job to use PSCP or Plink,
and the interactive host key prompt is making this difficult,
<em>add the correct host key to the registry ahead of time</em>.
That way you still get the convenience, but without losing the
security. We will <em>not</em> accept a command line option to turn
off host key checking, no matter how many people have already done
the work and send us polished production-quality patches.

<p>
If you have host keys available in the common `known_hosts' format, we
have
<a href="http://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty/contrib/kh2reg.py">a script</a>
to convert them to a Windows .REG file which can be installed ahead of
time by double-clicking.
