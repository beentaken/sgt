Summary: Terminal emulations other than xterm/ECMA-48 (e.g. 3270)

<p>
PuTTY aims to do one type of terminal emulation (approximately,
xterm/VTxxx/ECMA-48, which is widely used) and do it well.

<p>
PuTTY's authors primarily use it to access systems which have a
termcap/terminfo-like terminal abstraction layer, so the need to
emulate more than one type of character-cell terminal isn't very
important to us.

<p>
We are therefore unlikely to add support for wildly different forms of
terminal emulation such as IBM 3270 to the core of PuTTY.

<p>
This probably also goes for extra non-character-cell emulations such
as tek4014.
