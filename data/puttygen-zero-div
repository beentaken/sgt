<p>
We are getting <em>very</em> occasional reports of integer division by
zero errors in PuTTYgen.

<ul>

<li><code>15345.43775.42454.321823@chiark.greenend.org.uk</code>
<br>2001-11-13? (maybe already resolved)

<li><code>3CA268CA.7258.2CA7836@localhost</code>
<br>SSH-1 1024, Win95, version 0.52 (assuming that, as we were told,
`Teilungsfehler' is a division error)

<li><code>000001c2bb51$77afcbf0$6401a8c0@lynn</code>
<br>SSH-2 RSA 2048, version ???

<li><code>1645070571.20030227150247@inbox.ru</code>
<br>SSH-2 RSA 1024, version 0.53b
<br>At last, we have a stack trace:
<br><pre>PUTTYGEN! 00408160()  sshbn.obj:_internal_mod
PUTTYGEN! 004086fa()  sshbn.obj:_bigdivmod
PUTTYGEN! 00408ecd()  sshbn.obj:_modinv

</ul>

<b>SGT, 2003-06-28</b>: Believed fixed. Thankfully, the bug was not
in the bignum implementation (although I found a small bug in there
too in the course of fixing it!) but in the much simpler
prime-generation code that called it.
