<p>
The VT100 line drawing character set contains four characters (encoded
as o,p,r,s) which are vertically offset versions of the normal box-drawing
horizontal line character (q). On Windows, PuTTY displays these by
displaying the ordinary horizontal line with a vertical offset, since
some fonts do not include the offset versions.

<p>
A bug in PuTTY's Windows text display code was causing other VT100
characters immediately to the right of one of those to be displayed
using the same horizontal offset.
