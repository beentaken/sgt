Summary: pterm's relationship to saved sessions should be clarified
Class: semi-bug
Present-in: 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
The documented way to configure <tt>pterm</tt> is by using
command-line arguments and/or X resources.

<p>
However, <tt>pterm</tt> also currently takes notice of PuTTY saved
sessions in <tt>~/.putty</tt>, including Default Settings, and
responds to the <tt>-load</tt> command-line option. Since 0.58, the
saved sessions have also been visible on the Change Settings dialog.

<p>
This semi-support is more or less by accident. It's not clear that
it's the right thing to do, it may be buggy or broken in various
regards, and it may go away in future.

<p>
We should either support this properly and document it, or remove it.
