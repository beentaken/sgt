Summary: "unexpected packet type 95" with VShell 2.1.5
Class: bug
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
We've had one report of the error <code>Unexpected response to
shell/command request: packet type 95</code> when connecting to VShell
2.1.5 with PSCP.

<p>
Packet type 95 is <code>SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA</code>. Perhaps
this is VShell complaining on stderr about a nonexistent SFTP server
subsystem, or similar?

<p>
This seems likely to have the same root cause as
<a href="portfwd-at-start.html">`portfwd-at-start'</a>: brittle code
at connection startup.
