<p>When there are Default Settings configured, Plink on Unix will use the
terminal height and width from there rather than querying the terminal
itself.  This is inappropriate, since the default settings are there to
configure the size of PuTTY's terminal windows rather than to override
the size of the terminal Plink is running in.
