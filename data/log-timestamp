Summary: Timestamps in logs
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low

Timestamps would occasionally be useful in the log files PuTTY
produces.

Deciding where to put timestamps in SSH packet logs is trivial --
packet starts and Event Log entries.

Some people want timestamping in raw terminal logs. This is a rather
harder design problem.
