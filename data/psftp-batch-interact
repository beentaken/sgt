Summary: PSFTP: continue interactively after a batch script
Class: wish
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>A user requests:

<blockquote><p>
I would like to be able to run a batch file and then _not_ exit, but
instead simply continue interactively while still logged in to the host.
The key reason is to be able to set default to a particular directory
but then take interactive control. Allowing a batch file to run before
the user takes control would be a general purpose way to do this.

<p>I could image a command line option (-bu  for Batch and continUe?), but
a batch command (end ?) would tie into a possible general purpose
<a href="scripting">scripting</a> capability at some time in the future.
