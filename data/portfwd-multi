Summary: Port forwarding should cope better with already-used ports
Difficulty: mayhem
Priority: medium
Class: semi-bug
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
When attempting to open a forwarded port that's already bound (e.g.
running multiple sessions with the same port forwarding settings),
PuTTY should warn that it was unable to open the port (perhaps a line
in the Event Log). (Currently it just acts as though both instances
successfully opened the port.)

<p>
Worryingly, this doesn't look like a PuTTY problem; it seems that
Windows is happy to let the second PuTTY process open the port for
listening, and report success, and never thinks to tell it that the
port is already in use by the first PuTTY. Running the Windows 2000
`netstat' utility even lists the same port twice.

<p>
Therefore, there's probably nothing we can do about this.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> It's been suggested that it could be down to the
<code>setsockopt(SO_REUSEADDR)</code> in <code>winnet.c:sk_newlistener()</code>.
(Not verified.) Could we remove this, or even use
<code><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/using_so_exclusiveaddruse.asp">SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</a></code>?
(Although this
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/socket_options.asp">isn't available on 95/98/Me</a>.)
