<p>
Apparently, for some people, PuTTY randomly becomes unresponsive with
Win2000/XP.

<p>
We've been getting rare but persistent reports of this for a while,
but there seems to have been a rash of them recently (Feb 2004). None
of us have ever seen this, so we're going to need some help if we're
to stop it happening.

<p>
Common characteristics of the reports we've had:
<ul>
<li>When one PuTTY hangs, they all hang, including any new instances
attempted (once they get to opening a terminal window), until the
system is restarted. But other applications on the same system are
unaffected.
<li>When trying to close PuTTY via the task manager, one receives a
message like "This program cannot be closed. If it is being debugged,
please resume it or close the debugger first."
<li>It doesn't seem to be correlated with any particular event - it
can occur hours into an established connection.
<li>It's claimed that the PuTTY backend is still functional (sending
keepalives, etc).
<li>Might only happen with SSH? (1 and 2)
</ul>

<p>
If I had to make a guess, I'd investigate some of the trickery we use
to get noise for random numbers. My notes also suggest that I thought
someone thought that sound might be implicated, but I can't find any
evidence for that now.
