Summary: PuTTY misinterprets SCI as DECID

When using an ISO 8-bit character set (like ISO 8859-1), character code 0x9a
is the C1 control SCI, Single Character Introducer, whose use is "reserved
for future standardization" by ECMA-48.  PuTTY, though, internally translates
it into ESC Z, which it then interprets as DECID for VT52 compatibility.
This is particularly unfortunate since it means that there's a single byte
that causes PuTTY to send data back to the server, which tends to cause
problems for people foolish enough as to "cat" binary files.
