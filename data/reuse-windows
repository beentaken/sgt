<p>
Perhaps an inactive window should have a menu option to reactivate
the session (like Duplicate Session but in the same window).

<p>
We've had one request for a "Duplicate + Kill" option. Perhaps this
would be a sensible behaviour if the new "reconnect" option were
invoked on a live session. (With suitable prompting, of course.)

<p>
(Some people would like this to happen
<a href="reconnect-auto.html">automatically</a>.)

<b>SGT, 2004-08-14</b>: Just implemented a "Restart Session" menu
option, on both Unix and Windows PuTTY. Mostly because Owen
questioned whether this feature was really easy enough to label as
"fun". It hadn't occurred to me before that challenging my
competence was a way to motivate me to do stuff :-)
