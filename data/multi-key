<p><tt>E1Cp2HC-0004Ni-00@chiark.greenend.org.uk</tt>:

<p><pre> The Multi_Key (that is the X Compose key) doesn't appear to work in
pterm.  In other applications if I type "&lt;Multi_Key&gt; ' e" then I get
an e-acute whereas in pterm I just get 'e.</pre>

<p>
<tt>unix/gtkwin.c:key_event()</tt> contains the following comment:

<p><pre>/*
 * NYI: Compose key (!!! requires Unicode faff before even trying)
 */</pre>

<em>Update:</em> fixed in r9567 (with fallout addressed in r9568 and
r9573).
