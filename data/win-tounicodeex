Summary: Unicode character input on Windows (for Romanian, etc)
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Fixed-in: r9942 2013-07-21

On Windows, some locales are such that there are keys on the keyboard
corresponding to characters that are not in the system code page.
PuTTY's use of ToAsciiEx() means that such characters can't easily be
entered with PuTTY.

Apparently this is a particular problem with Romanian keyboards and
the characters
  U+0219  LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH COMMA BELOW
  U+021B  LATIN SMALL LETTER T WITH COMMA BELOW
which are standardised in ISO-8859-16, which isn't supported by
Windows XP. It's also been suggested that Armenian and Georgian
locales are affected.

Switching to ToUnicodeEx() avoids the problem.
