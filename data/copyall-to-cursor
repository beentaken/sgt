<p>
The documentation of the menu option "Copy All to Clipboard" claims
that it copies "the whole contents of the terminal screen and
scrollback to the clipboard in one go."

<p>
However, it does not copy any text from locations on or after the
current cursor position.

<p>
The first release this feature was present in is 0.51.
