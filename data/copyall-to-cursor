<p>
The documentation of the menu option "Copy All to Clipboard" claims
that it copies "the whole contents of the terminal screen and
scrollback to the clipboard in one go."

<p>
However, it does not copy any text from locations on or after the
current cursor position.

<p>
The first release this feature was present in is 0.51.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> This has been fixed. However, we've decided to make
it copy only up to the last <em>non-empty</em> line on the terminal,
in case anyone was relying on something like the old behaviour.
