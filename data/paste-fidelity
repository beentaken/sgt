Summary: Extra fidelity in copy and paste operations

<p>
Extra features in pasting. Perhaps PuTTY could somehow remember
which on-screen spaces had been output as the result of a tab
character, and which were genuine spaces, and reproduce that when
copying to the clipboard. Likewise, perhaps, trailing spaces. Also,
since we now allow RTF pasting, perhaps it could paste style
information (bold, italic etc) alongside the actual text.

<p>
<strong>Update:</strong> Since r6555 pasting in RTF now includes colour
and style information.

<p>
Probably at least some of these features will want to be
configurable off, since I can imagine them causing trouble in some
situations.
