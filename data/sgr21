Summary: PuTTY's interpretation of SGR 21 differs from Linux's

ECMA-48 defines SGR 21 as enabling double-underline.  PuTTY interprets this
the same as single-underline (SGR 4).  SCOANSI and Linux interpret it as
turning off bold, and at least some applications seem to rely on this.
VT520 and xterm don't support this sequence at all.  Perhaps PuTTY should
align its behaviour with one of the others.  xterm would be more ideologically
pure, but SCOANSI might be more generally useful.
