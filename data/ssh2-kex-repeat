Summary: Ability to initiate SSH2 key re-exchange
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Depends: ssh2-kex-data

<p>
Either side of an SSH2 connection may initiate a key re-exchange.
Not all servers bother to do this, although I suspect most are happy
to accept a re-exchange initiated by the client.

<p>
PuTTY currently never initiates a re-exchange; it relies on the
server to do so, and responds to it when it does. This doesn't
always happen - at least some versions of the OpenSSH server follow
the same policy, which means a re-exchange never occurs. We
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-newmodes-01.txt">really ought</a>
to initiate re-exchange ourselves if the server doesn't.

<p>
Before this can be done, we need to fix <a
href="ssh2-kex-data.html">ssh2-kex-data</a>, since otherwise the
chances of receiving a data packet from the server just after
sending our KEXINIT would be unacceptably high.
