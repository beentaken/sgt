Summary: Send terminal speeds in SSH

<p>
We've had a couple of requests for PuTTY to transmit a terminal speed
in SSH, as it already does for Telnet and Rlogin protocols.

<p>
Apparently server defaults in the absence of information from PuTTY
aren't always helpful; in particular, OpenSSH on HP-UX ends up at 300
baud(!), and this causes <code>vi</code> and <code>emacs</code> to
invoke various emergency procedures (e.g., <code>vi</code> uses a
5-line display).

<p>
As of 2004-04-25, PuTTY will send terminal speeds in SSH based on the
same terminal-speed string as for other protocols (which has been
moved to the Connection panel in the UI).

<p>
Currently there's no way to turn <em>off</em> the sending of terminal
speeds in SSH (speeds are <em>always</em> sent). If anyone complains,
we can change this.
