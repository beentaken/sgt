<p>
PuTTY doesn't support the "arcfour" (RC4) cipher in SSH-2.  Arcfour is
notable for being sunstantially faster than any cipher that PuTTY
currently supports.  Unfortunately, the way it's specified for SSH-2,
without discarding the first 1024 bytes of keystream, it's rather
weaker than it could be (though not dangerously so).  On the other
hand, not being a CBC-mode block cipher, it doesn't suffer from the
problems described in ssh2-cbc-weakness.

<p>
Using arcfour (or any other stream cipher) in SSH-1 would be a very bad
idea.  The lack of a MAC makes it very easy for an attacker to modify
the data stream.

<b>Update:</b> Ben Harris has written an Internet-Draft (currently
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes-02.txt">draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes-02</a>)
describing a way of using Arcfour reasonably securely with SSH-2, and
PuTTY now implements this.
