Summary: Implement sending of terminal modes

SSH (both v1 and v2) allows the client to specify the mode it wants
server-side pseudo-terminals to be opened in.

<p>
I've always thought it would be nice to be able to configure this
sort of thing locally, so that (for example) users connecting to the
<a href="http://www.mono.org">mono.org</a>
BBS could stop a single press of Ctrl-\ from sending a SIGQUIT and
unexpectedly terminating their session.

<p>
Recently it was suggested to me that if the user has configured
non-`auto' settings for local echo and/or local line editing, then
perhaps PuTTY should deliberately send terminal modes which
compensate for this on the server side? For example, if the user
turns line editing off at the client end, we could send ICANON so
that it's turned on at the server end; or conversely if the user
enables local line editing we could send ~ICANON. It isn't remotely
clear to me that this would be the right thing in all circumstances,
though, so perhaps it would be better to leave it as a
user-configurable option.

<p>
(This wish applies minimally to Telnet as well, since we can send
WILL ECHO / WONT ECHO to announce an intention to do any echoing
locally, and the server is expected to stop doing its own echoing if
it thinks we're doing it ourselves. Configurable options in this
area might also be directly usable by the pty back end in pterm.)
