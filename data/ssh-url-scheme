Summary: Support for an "ssh" URL scheme

<p>
  Some people would like PuTTY to be able to accept "ssh" (and "raw") URLs
  on the command-line, in the same way as it accepts "telnet" ones.
<p>
  At present, though, there is no
  <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes">URL scheme</a>
  for SSH registered with <a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a>, and
  the PuTTY developers don't have the time to go through the
  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2717.txt">registration procedure</a>
  for a new one.  If someone specifies and registers such a URL scheme,
  support for it will almost certainly be added to PuTTY.
