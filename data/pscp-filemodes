Summary: Control of file permissions in PSCP

It would be nice if PSCP could allow user control of the file
permissions it sends to the remote side when uploading files. I'm
not entirely sure what the user interface for this should be, but
whatever it is I think it would have to be a blanket option covering
all files transferred in a single connection - it would just be too
fiddly to give fine-grained control when copying many files.
