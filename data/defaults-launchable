Summary: "Default Settings" can be launchable, leading to confusion
Class: bug

<p>
When PuTTY loads a saved session, it will under some circumstances
automatically launch it if it's launchable. "Launchable" used to
simply mean that it actually specified a host name to connect to,
but due to <a href="serial-backend.html">the serial port backend</a>
it's now a more complex criterion.

<p>
The original intention of the PuTTY configuration storage was that
"Default Settings" should never describe a session which is
launchable, which is why we don't permit a host name to be saved in
the default settings. (People occasionally complain about this.)

<p>
However, due to an oversight, it <em>is</em> now possible to have
Default Settings describe a launchable session: simply set
"Protocol" to "Serial", and have the "Serial line" box non-blank (as
it is by default). This leads to undesirable behaviour.

<p>
I'm not sure how best to fix this. Restricting what can be stored in
Default Settings so that even serial-based defaults are forced not
to be launchable seems to me like the wrong answer. Perhaps the
right answer is actually to go through the code and ensure that
Default Settings in particular is never automatically launched
<em>even if launchable</em>. If we do that, then perhaps we could
also repeal the restriction on having a default host name saved in
Default Settings.
