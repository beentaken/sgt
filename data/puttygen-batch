Summary: Batch mode for Windows PuTTYgen

<p>
We're occasionally asked for a means of generating keys
non-interactively with the Windows version of PuTTYgen; for instance,
command-line arguments to specify the key type and so on.

<p>
The main reason that we haven't done this is that interaction would
still be required; there isn't a source of sufficiently good
randomness on Windows, so for key generation we make the user generate
some by waving the mouse around.

<p>
Also, since Windows PuTTYgen is a GUI application, even ignoring the
randomness issue (which can be ignored for automated format
conversions, for instance), using it from a batch file is slightly
tricky. Normally, it will not block the batch file, but this can be
dealt with with <tt>START /WAIT</tt>. Also, it probably won't be able
to interact with the console, so it's not clear how it can indicate
errors (let alone ask for passphrases). (Is the exit code accessible
to a batch file when using <tt>START /WAIT</tt>?) These problems might
necessitate a separate console application.

<p>
(The Unix version of PuTTYgen can and does run in a batch mode, as we
use <tt>/dev/random</tt> there, which is assumed to be a sufficiently
good source of randomness and doesn't require us to interact with the
user.)
