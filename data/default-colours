Summary: Be able to use the Windows default colour scheme

<p>
Windows allows you to globally configure the foreground and
background colour for text in application windows, across
<em>all</em> applications. Since PuTTY's own foreground and
background colour are configurable anyway, it currently ignores this
global configuration.

<p>
We should have a checkbox in the Colours panel which allows you to
specify that PuTTY's foreground and background colours should follow
the Windows default settings.

This</a> is a patch to implement this (looks sane -- needs documentation).
