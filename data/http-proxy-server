Summary: Present HTTP proxy interface to dynamic port forwarding

<p>
<a href="portfwd-dynamic.html">Dynamic port forwarding</a> presents a
SOCKS proxy interface. It might be nice to have the option of
presenting an HTTP proxy interface instead, since some clients
support that interface and not SOCKS.

<p>
A potential difficulty is that it's not clear how much of the large
and sprawling HTTP specification we would need to implement in
order to interoperate usefully.
