Summary: Resizing the window does the Wrong Thing to its contents
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low

<p>I (BJH) think that PuTTY's behaviour when the number of lines on the screen
is changed is currently wrong.  What it currently does is to keep the bottom
line of the screen in a fixed position relative to the text.  This means that
if the window is enlarged, lines get pulled out of the scrollback and added
to the screen, and if the window is shrunk, lines get pushed from the
screen to the scrollback.  A particularly nasty aspect of this is that if you
have a large window with a shell prompt at the top and you reduce its size,
the prompt disappears off the top of the window.  Pulling lines out of the
scrollback might also get awkward if we start storing the scrollback in a
compressed format.

<p>So what <em>should</em> we do?  xterm's fix to the disappearing-prompt
problem seems to be to delete lines from the bottom of the window when it's
shrunk unless that would delete the line containing the cursor, in which case
lines are deleted from the top instead.  When enlarging the window, xterm
pulls lines out of the scrollback just like PuTTY.  I still haven't decided
whether or not this is evil.  In any case, it should probably be inhibited in
alternate screen mode, just like copying data into the scrollback is (xterm
gets this bit wrong).

<p>Another subtlety is what to do about saved cursor positions.  At present in
PuTTY (and I think in xterm), if you open an 80x24 window, do something to
put stuff into the scrollback, switch to the alternate screen, enlarge the
window to the height of the screen and then switch back from the alternate
screen, you end up with the cursor on line 24, rather than at the bottom of
the screen with the text that used to be on line 24.  This is clearly wrong.

patch</a> to fix this.

<p>(cf. <a href="resize-no-truncate.html">`resize-no-truncate'</a> for the
case where the number of columns is changed.)

<p><b>SGT, 2003-03-07</b>: Just accepted a patch from Richard
Boulton which should fix this.
