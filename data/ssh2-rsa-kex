<p>
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4432.txt">RFC 4432</a>
(formerly draft-harris-ssh-rsa-kex) defines a means to use RSA key
exchange in SSH-2 (similar to SSH-1's key exchange, but without the
other disadvantages of SSH-1). This might be particularly suitable for
slow client systems.

<p>
There is a patch somewhere. We should find another implementation to
test it against, and commit it.
