There will probably not be a Windows CE port in the particularly near
future. Despite sharing large parts of the Windows API, in practice
WinCE doesn't appear to be significantly easier to port to than a
totally different operating system.

However, PuTTY on portable devices would clearly be a useful thing,
so in the long term I hope there will be a WinCE port.
