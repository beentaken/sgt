From <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/400804">Debian bug 400804</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>When i run puttygen (either to create a new key, or to translate an
openssh-style key), the emitted ppk file (the putty private key) is
created with the standard umask, which by default in debian leaves
things world-readable.

<p>this is in contrast to ssh-keygen from the openssh suite, which
creates private keys with group and other permissions all off, no
matter what the current umask.

<p>I think that ssh-keygen's approach is what people expect and intend
when it comes to public keys, and it's a better idea to make these
things safe-by-default.
