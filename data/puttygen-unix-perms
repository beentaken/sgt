From <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/400804">Debian bug 400804</a>:
<blockquote>
<p>When i run puttygen (either to create a new key, or to translate an
openssh-style key), the emitted ppk file (the putty private key) is
created with the standard umask, which by default in debian leaves
things world-readable.

<p>this is in contrast to ssh-keygen from the openssh suite, which
creates private keys with group and other permissions all off, no
matter what the current umask.

<p>I think that ssh-keygen's approach is what people expect and intend
when it comes to public keys, and it's a better idea to make these
things safe-by-default.

This issue corresponds to
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7162">CVE-2006-7162</a>.
(Note that some versions of the advisories for this issue incorrectly
state that 0.59 is vulnerable. For the avoidance of doubt, this issue
only affects 0.58 and prior, and only the Unix version.)
