Summary: Foundry Networks 1.2.27 port has SSH_MSG_IGNORE bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: fun

Some Foundry Networks devices apparently include an F-Secure-derived SSH
server which reports itself as "1.2.27", but has the SSH_MSG_IGNORE bug,
which both PuTTY and OpenSSH think stock 1.2.27 doesn't have.

PuTTY could deal with this by assuming that all things claiming to be 1.2.27
have this bug, though that might be considered ugly.
