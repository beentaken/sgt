Summary: `nonexistent channel -1' crashes
Class: bug

<p>
We're getting occasional reports of PuTTY sessions dying with
messages like "Server sent disconnect message: received data for
nonexistent channel -1". Reports so far:
<ul>
<li>
OpenSSH-1.2.3 on Debian potato, 0.52 on W2K, port forwarding "mapping
port 993 to 3993" (don't know which way)
<br>"Server sent disconnect message: received data for nonexistent
channel -1"
</li>
<li>
"SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_2.9.9p2", 2002-03-14 on XP Pro
<br>"Server sent disconnect message. Received ieof for nonexistent channel -1"
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Update:</b>
We believed this fixed as of 2002 May 18 (and have had one person
report that our fix made their problem go away), but we've received
one report that the `ieof' variant at least is still out there (in
2002-07-04).
