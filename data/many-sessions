<p>
PuTTY's saved sessions list box is fine for people with only a few
saved sessions, but some people (such as sysadmins) might plausibly
have a much larger number of them and might find the list box
unwieldy.

<p>
One solution to this is to invent a means of categorising saved
sessions, perhaps by introducing a hierarchical directory structure
within the saved-sessions list. (Some list entries would be
directories, which you could click on to go down a level; in any
non-root directory there would be a `back up a level' item you could
click on to go back up.)

<p>
A smaller and simpler alternative would be simply to allow the PuTTY
config box to be resized - and grow the saved sessions list box as
the window grows. We've been deliberately keeping the config box
small for the benefit of people with 640x480 screens, but if a
particular user were to want to expand their own config box there'd
be no reason to prevent them. For this to be really useful I suppose
PuTTY would have to remember the size of its config box...

<p>
Another possibility would be to sort the sessions based on most
recent access time.  I'm not sure how users would cope with their
sessions' being shuffled all the time, though.

<p>
It's not impossible that we might want to do all of these things,
or something else entirely. Some design is required.
