Summary: Window titles not interpreted according to current charset
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: fun

If an escape sequence (e.g. OSC 0) sets the window title bar, the text
in the escape sequence is just sent to the window system for display.
We should make sure it is interpreted according to whatever character
set / codepage the terminal emulator is currently using.
