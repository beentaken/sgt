<p>
PSFTP could do with more features: options and wildcards to ls (-l
etc), and perhaps recursive transfer of whole directories like scp.
(After all, we can <em>do</em> this in SFTP already!)

<p>
If we implement the recursion stuff, could do with pulling it out
from scp.c into something more common.

<p>
Need to think about reget-type operation with mget?

<b>SGT, 2004-12-16</b>: Recursion is now implemented (<code>get
-r</code> and <code>put -r</code>), and so are wildcards
(<code>mget</code> and <code>mput</code>, basically like the
standard <code>ftp</code> client). <code>ls</code> also supports
wildcards.
