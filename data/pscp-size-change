Summary: PSCP assertion failure if remote source file changes size
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
If PSCP is used to copy a remote file to the local machine, and the
remote file changes in size during the transfer (e.g., an active log
file), PSCP can give an error message like "Assertion failed:
actuallen &lt;= len, file scp.c, line 1435".

<p>
(Note that the same error used to occur for static but
<a href="large-files.html">particularly large files</a>.)
