Summary: Proxy crash caused by uninitialised structure members
Class: bug
Difficulty: fun
Priority: high

Attempting connection with a proxy could cause a crash due to
uninitialised structure members in proxy data structures.

I (JTN) had only been able to reproduce this with my own local builds
(which use a different compiler / libc to the releases and snapshots).
However, we've had one report of it cropping up with the 0.53b release
on WinXP Pro. There isn't really a workaround other than to use the
snapshots instead.
