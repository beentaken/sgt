Summary: Unix Plink should set O_NONBLOCK on stdout and stderr

If stdout from Unix Plink is going to a FIFO, and the reader of that
FIFO stops reading (say someone has ^Zed it), Plink hangs, stopping
port-forwardings and so forth.  This is silly, and seems to result
from failing to set O_NONBLOCK on stdout and stderr.
