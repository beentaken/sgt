Summary: Restart capability in PSCP
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: tricky

Now that PSCP supports SFTP as a back end, it might be quite nice to
implement the restart capability when retrying a half-finished file
transfer ("reget" / "reput" in PSFTP).

It's relatively obvious how this should work for single-file
transfer (it would have to be explicitly enabled using a
command-line option), but the design will need some thought for
multi-file and recursive transfers. Also the whole thing will have
to fail, or degrade gracefully, if PSCP ends up using the original
SCP1 protocol instead of SFTP.
