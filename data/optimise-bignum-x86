Summary: x86 bignum optimisation for more compilers
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: medium

sshbn.c contains conditionally-activated optimised code for x86
processors which uses 32-bit chunks instead of 16-bit ones, and a
small amount of inline assembler to force fast arithmetic with these
chunks. This makes a noticeable difference to bignum operations such
as at SSH connection setup.

We only have appropriate compiler goop for GCC currently, so this code
will only be activated on many Linux/Unix x86 builds and MinGW/Cygwin
Windows builds; in particular, it's not in our standard builds, which
are done with MS Visual C.
