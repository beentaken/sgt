Summary: Option to have Alt key set the meta bit

<p>
At present, the Alt key causes keys it's combined with to be sent preceded
by ESC.  This is interpreted as a "meta" key by GNUish programs like 
Emacs, but some others (notably NetHack) don't understand this convention,
and expect "meta" to set the top bit of the character instead.  There should
probably be an option to enable this behaviour.

<p>
When I (BJH) last mentioned this to Simon, he asked what should be done
about keys that transmit multiple characters (<i>e.g.</i> function keys).
I think the best move is probably to have them entirely unaffected by
Alt in this mode.
