Summary: Choice of loopback addresses for local port forwardings
Class: semi-bug

Someone suggested that it might be useful to be able to specify
which loopback address PuTTY should bind to when listening on local
ports for local-to-remote port forwardings. Apparently, if you want
to, you can listen separately on 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and
so on.

This would be useful because it would enable the use of the normal
port numbers for forwarded services. Might be particularly handy
when forwarding SMB.

The user interface for this would probably just involve specifying
the IP address alongside the port number in the Tunnels panel:
instead of asking to forward port 3456, you'd ask for
127.0.0.2:3456.

(Apparently this is also useful for forwarding Windows Terminal
Services -- see <99ab3348.0405241707.74fa3d6b@posting.google.com>.)
