Summary: Reset terminal state when restarting session
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: fun
Priority: medium

<p>
PuTTY now has the ability to <a href="reuse-windows.html">reuse terminal
windows</a> with the `Restart Session' option. However, the terminal may be
in some bad state (cursor off, black text on black background, or whatever),
or the prompts for the new session may appear in the middle of the 
previous session's output.

<p>
We could put more effort into sanitising the terminal state, while keeping
the previous session's info on screen for reference. Suggested actions
(to take place when the new session starts):
<ul>
<li>Reset all attributes to defaults (colours, bold, cursor, character set
etc etc);
<li>Move cursor to the first column;
<li>Move cursor to after the last "used" row on the screen, scrolling
down if necessary.
</ul>
