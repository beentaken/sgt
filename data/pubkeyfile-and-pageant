Summary: Pageant + explicit keyfile gives  non-optimal behaviour
Class: bug
Difficulty: fun
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.53b
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
The behaviour of the PuTTY tools when Pageant is running and a keypair
is explicitly specified (via <code>-i</code>, configuration or whatever)
isn't ideal.

<p>
This is particularly obvious when several keys are valid for a given
connection (e.g., if one is trying to use a particular key to run
a particular forced command). However, I suspect the issues aren't
limited to this case.
