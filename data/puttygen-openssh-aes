<p>
From the
<a href="http://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-announce/2010-March/000098.html">OpenSSH 5.4 changelog</a>:

<pre> * Passphrase-protected SSH protocol 2 private keys are now protected
   with AES-128 instead of 3DES. This applied to newly-generated keys
   as well as keys that are reencrypted (e.g. by changing their
   passphrase).</pre>

<p>
PuTTYgen should certainly learn to import such keys. It should
probably also have the option to export keys encrypted with either
cipher.

<b>SGT, 2010-04-12</b>: r8917 can now import the new keys, but won't
export them yet.
