Summary: Authenticate with local X servers

<p>
X11 forwarding currently doesn't even attempt to authenticate with
the local X server. In order for it to do so, PuTTY would have to
know where to look for authentication data. It would be nice if this
were to happen.

<p>
A simple approach might be for PuTTY just to pass on authentication
data supplied by the X11 client if it has no better ideas.  The X
Protocol Manual suggests that servers should ignore any authentication
they aren't expecting, so this shouldn't break anything that currently
works, and it would allow the user to copy back PuTTY's cookie to their
real X server.
