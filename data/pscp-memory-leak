<p>
We've had numerous reports of a memory leak in PSCP 0.52 such that its
memory consumption would grow with the quantity of data transferred.

<p>
A big memory leak in sftp.c was fixed 2002-03-01. This would show up
in PSCP when it chose to use the SFTP backend (most often with SSH-2
connections).
