Summary: PuTTYgen shouldn't insist that p > q in imported OpenSSH RSA private keys
Class: bug

<p>
OpenSSH-format RSA private keys (also known as PEM format) contain a
base64-encoded PKCS#1 RSAPrivateKey.  When generated by OpenSSL, these
always have p > q, but this isn't actually required by PKCS#1.  At present,
PuTTYgen will reject keys where p &lt; q, but it should accept them and make
whatever changes are necessary to have them work with PuTTY's RSA code.
