Summary: Support for GSSAPI (for Kerberos, GSI, etc)

<p>
We occasionally get requests for Kerberos and/or GSSAPI support.

<p>
This looks complicated and messy, and isn't that important to us,
so we're rather unlikely to add it ourselves.

<p>
Any proposed solution should take into account our
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/puttydoc/AppendixD.html">design guidelines</a>
to be even considered for inclusion. In particular, some submissions
have not taken into account PuTTY's cross-platform nature.

<p>
In SSH-2, Kerberos is supported through
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/kerberos-faq/general/section-84.html">
GSSAPI</a>; there is an expired Internet-Draft
(<tt><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/secsh/draft-ietf-secsh-gsskeyex/">draft-ietf-secsh-gsskeyex</a></tt>)
describing GSSAPI key exchange
and user authentication. (Some of the patches here appear to be based
on earlier versions of this specification, for instance the userauth
method "gssapi".)

<p>
It appears that Globus <a href="http://www.globus.org/security/">
GSI</a> authentication also uses GSSAPI, though for some reason needs
a different client implementation (and yet a third if you want to support
both).

<p>Patches we've seen:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.certifiedsecuritysolutions.com/">Certified Security
Solutions</a> have a
<a href="http://www.certifiedsecuritysolutions.com/downloads.html">patched
version of PuTTY</a> which supports Kerberos 5 in SSH-1 and GSSAPI key
exchange and user authentication in SSH-2. For GSSAPI, Win9x/NT
require the 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dist/index.html">MIT Kerberos library</a>;
Win2K/XP can use Microsoft SSPI.

<li>
Another patch (unreviewed): <tt>1067597353.3fa23e29bf70c@webmail.technion.ac.il</tt>
<br>User authentication; <tt>secur32.lib</tt> (Windows) /
<tt>krb5-config</tt> (Unix)

<li>
Another patch <a href="http://sweb.cz/v_t_m/">here</a> adds support
for GSSAPI user authentication using the MIT Kerberos library. (A
previous version of this patch has been reviewed and found wanting.)

<li>
Yet another patch, at
<a href="http://rc.vintela.com/topics/putty/downloads/putty-0.56vrc0.1-2.patch">vintela.com</a>
<br>3-term BSD licence; GSSAPI (Kerberos-specific?) user
authentication using MS SSPI; not thoroughly reviewed but doesn't look
hopeful

</ul>

<p>
Binary-only versions:

<ul>

<li>
Centrify provide a
<a href="http://www.centrify.com/resources/putty.asp">modified version of PuTTY</a>
which uses the Windows SSPI for GSSAPI support. It includes features
specific to their other products.

</ul>
