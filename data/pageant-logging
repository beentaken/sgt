Summary: Logging for Pageant
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Depends: pageant-key-mgmt
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
It would be good if Pageant could provide a log of requests that have
been made of it (who, what, when) - particularly useful if agent
forwarding is in use. Perhaps something in the style of PuTTY's Event
Log? Perhaps a persistent disk log would also be useful.

<p>
If nothing else, this gives you a means of finding out if agent
forwardings have been unexpectedly abused.

<p>
Probably depends on <a href="pageant-key-mgmt.html">better key management</a>
to some extent.
