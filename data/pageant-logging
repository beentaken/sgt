Summary: Logging for Pageant
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Depends: pageant-key-mgmt
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
It would be good if Pageant could provide a log of requests that have
been made of it (who, what, when) - particularly useful if agent
forwarding is in use. Perhaps something in the style of PuTTY's Event
Log?

<p>
Probably depends on better key management.
