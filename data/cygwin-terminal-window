Summary: Use PuTTY as a local GUI terminal app for the Cygwin shell

<p>
It would be nice to be able to use PuTTY as a local terminal window
application for Cygwin shell sessions: a sort of local
<code>xterm</code>-alike (or rather, <code>pterm</code>-alike).

<p>
This is a perfectly feasible piece of work (much, much more so than
the superficially similar-looking but far more difficult
<a href="win-command-prompt.html">win-command-prompt</a>), and in fact
it can just about be achieved without any actual changes to PuTTY.
PuTTY's support for talking to a local Windows proxy subprocess in
place of making a network connection permits a solution in which that
proxy subprocess sets up a Cygwin pseudo-terminal, and speaks Telnet
on its standard input and output (which connect to PuTTY). So you
would configure PuTTY to think it was making a telnet connection to
localhost, but actually interpose this helper program via the Proxy
configuration panel &#8211; and the effect is that PuTTY speaks
directly to the Telnet implementation in the helper program, which
starts a Cygwin pty and runs a shell in it.

<p>
So the helper process has to be a Cygwin application (it must link
against the Cygwin DLL so it can work with the Cygwin emulation of
ptys), and it needs to speak Telnet on its standard I/O channels and
at the other end talk to a pty. In other words, it's actually very
similar to a Unix telnet daemon, of the type that can be launched
from <code>inetd</code>.

<p>
In fact, it would be <em>really</em> nice if Cygwin's
own <code>telnetd</code> could be used to do this job. Then an
unmodified PuTTY could talk to an unmodified Cygwin installation with
only a mildly fiddly piece of configuration.

<p>
However, when I actually tried this I found that Cygwin's telnet
server wouldn't quite do the job: for instance, it wouldn't operate in
the absence of syslogd, and it didn't have a command-line option to
make it invoke some program other than <code>login</code> in its
pseudo-terminal. I wouldn't expect that those should be difficult
features to add, but I've never got round to making a serious effort
to write them properly and get them accepted upstream.

<p>
However, I have written a small and specialist Telnet server of my own
which <em>is</em> suitable for this job. (That was a lot less work
than it sounds, since several pieces of PuTTY were easily reused to do
most of the heavy lifting &#8211; client-side and server-side Telnet
are very similar.) I'm just not sure how to sensibly package it, since
really it should be a Cygwin application so as to work with Cygwin
installations of all versions, but in that case it's better just to
adapt Cygwin telnetd...

<p>
In the meantime, though, for anyone who wants to use it, here's the
(currently rather long and involved) process for setting it up:
<ul>
<li>
For a start, make sure you have a PuTTY containing the fix for
<a href="local-proxy-telnet.html">local-proxy-telnet</a>, which is
critical to this mechanism working at all.
<li>
Get the source code for my Telnet server, which is in the
subdirectory <code>contrib/cygtermd</code> of the PuTTY source tree.
(You can get the PuTTY source code from
the <a href="../download.html">Download page</a>, as a zip or tar file
or by checking it out from Subversion.)
<li>
In the <code>contrib/cygtermd</code> directory, run the
Cygwin <code>make</code> command. (You will need
Cygwin's <code>make</code> and <code>gcc</code> installed.) This will
create an executable file called <code>cygtermd.exe</code>.
<li>
Copy <code>cygtermd.exe</code> into Cygwin's <code>/bin</code>
directory. (This is unfortunately necessary because it will be run by
a non-Cygwin application and will therefore need to be in the same
directory as the Cygwin DLL in order to find it.)
<li>
Now configure PuTTY to run a session using cygtermd, as follows.
<ul>
<li>
On the front page (Session panel):
<ul>
<li>
Set connection type to Telnet.
<li>
Enter something in the host name box. (PuTTY won't launch a session at
all unless it believes it's connecting to <em>something</em>; also
whatever you type here will go in the window title bar. "localhost" is
probably sufficient, if you have no better idea.)
</ul>
<li>
In the Proxy panel:
<ul>
<li>
Tick the box labelled "Consider proxying local host connections".
(Otherwise, PuTTY will not use the information in this panel to
override its default behaviour of just making a normal Telnet
connection to your local machine.)
<li>
Set "Proxy type" to Local.
<li>
Enter in the command line field a Windows command line which launches
cygtermd in the right directory and with the right subcommand.
cygtermd will expect a directory name as its first argument (in Cygwin
style), and will interpret the rest of its arguments as a command
line. So you might, for instance, do something like this:
<pre>c:\cygwin\bin\cygtermd.exe /home/simon /bin/bash -login
</pre>
which would arrange that the helper program will be run in
Cygwin's <code>/home/simon</code> directory, and will launch the
program "<code>/bin/bash -login</code>" (i.e. a normal Cygwin login
shell) inside the telnet session.
</ul>
<li>
In the Data panel:
<ul>
<li>
You should be able to configure your terminal type and set environment
variables, if you want to do either of those things. cygtermd supports
the Telnet options for both.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
This is all a lot of hassle, even though it only has to be set up
once. If Cygwin telnetd were fixed so that it could do the job of my
cygtermd utility, I would probably think it reasonable to add a piece
of dedicated PuTTY user interface to make it trivially easy to run a
local Cygwin shell session.

<p>
Our <a href="../links.html">Links page</a> links to a modified version
of PuTTY called PuTTYcyg, which was able to act as a Cygwin local
terminal (again using a helper process linked against Cygwin) before
PuTTY proper could do so.
