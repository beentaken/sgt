<p>
There appears to be some bogosity in the way keyboard accelerators
work in PuTTYgen. (Unless otherwise specified, the below is with Win2K
SP3.)

<p>
First, there's an outright clash between the accelerators for the
`<b>C</b>onversions' menu and the `Key <b>c</b>omment' edit box. (The
latter isn't visible unless a key is loaded.) Bizarrely, typing Alt+C
when no key is loaded causes a key to be generated (perhaps the
`<b>G</b>enerate' button is the next available control?).

<p>
Keyboard accelerators don't appear to work as expected during <em>and
after</em> key generation. (During keygen, all controls are disabled,
but menus can be accessed with the mouse.) I need to switch away and
back before they work again. (Possibly related: during key generation,
frobbing Alt appears to count as randomness.)

<p>
Under Wine (Debian version 0.0.20020904-1), the menu bar doesn't appear <em>at
all</em> until you type an appropriate accelerator key.
