Summary: An embedded version of Dropbear gets confused by SSH_MSG_IGNORE
Difficulty: taxing

<p>We've had a report of a problem with SSH-2 connections to a Tandberg
video conferencing codec running what claims to be "dropbear_0.45".  
The codec announces itself as "TANDBERG Codec Release F6.0 NTSC /
SW Release Date: 2007-04-27".

<p>The
connection ends up using a CBC cipher mode, and the codec drops the TCP
connection after receiving the first empty SSH_MSG_IGNORE from PuTTY.
This problem doesn't affect PuTTY 0.58 because it doesn't send such
messages.  A version of PuTTY clobbered to never send SSH_MSG_IGNORE works,
as does 0.56 (modulo an independent bug), despite the latter's sending
non-zero-size SSH_MSG_IGNOREs along with SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST.

<p>This problem doesn't seem to occur with vanilla
<a href="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">Dropbear</a> 0.45.

<p>A bug-compatibility option could be added to deal with this, but it's
not very clear either what systems are affected or what the limits of the bug
are.
