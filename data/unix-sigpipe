Summary: Unix Plink dies with SIGPIPE when a forwarded port closes
Present-in: r7735

If I set up a remote-to-local port forwarding, and use "nc -l" on the
local end and "nc" on the far end, killing the local "nc" causes Plink
to die with SIGPIPE.  It should just tidy up the forwarded connection
and carry on.
