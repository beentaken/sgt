<p>
Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.56 have a memory corruption
vulnerability in their treatment of received debug messages in SSH
protocol version 2 (SSH2_MSG_DEBUG).

<p>
This message is handled in <code>ssh2_rdpkt()</code>. A string length
is read from the SSH packet and clipped to the length of a buffer.
However, the string length is stored as a signed integer, and there is
no protection against its being large enough to be stored as a
negative number. This will bypass the length checking and appear as a
large positive number once again to the subsequent
<code>memcpy()</code>, causing a memory overflow. Code execution has
been demonstrated as a result of this overflow.

<p>
This bug is <b>EXTREMELY SEVERE</b>. PuTTY can process debug messages
at any time in the protocol, including during the initial key exchange
phase. Therefore, this bug can be exploited by a malicious server,
<em>before</em> the client has received and verified a host key
signature. So this attack can be performed by a man-in-the-middle
between the SSH client and server, and the normal host key protections
against MITM attacks are bypassed. Even if you trust the server you
<em>think</em> you are connecting to, you are not safe.

<p>
This bug does not affect SSH protocol version 1, as the SSH1_MSG_DEBUG
string length is sanity-checked against the packet length before use.
