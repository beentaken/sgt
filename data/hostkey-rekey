<p>
There's currently undesirable behaviour if you answer "accept once"
for a host key at startup and then leave the connection open for long
enough to trigger a rekey: since the host key has only been accepted
once, the confirmation message is put up again, which is pretty nasty
(especially in the command-line tools). Certainly at the very least we
should treat "accept once" on a host key to mean accept for the whole
of a <em>session</em> rather than for a single KEX; additionally, we
probably ought to think about some sort of sensible behaviour if a
different host key to that we originally accepted is used at rekey
time, or if the key in the client's cache has changed.
