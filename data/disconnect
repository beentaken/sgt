<p>Better handling of the connection closing, and of SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT
being received. Ideally we should maintain our own idea of when and
whether we <em>expect</em> to see a closure, and only signal clean
exit when a closure or disconnect arrives that we were expecting. If
one arrives unexpectedly it should count as an ungraceful closure,
display a dialog box containing the text out of MSG_DISCONNECT, and
not close the window unless the user selected "Always".

<p><b>SGT, 2005-01-11</b>: In fact, SSH is really simple in this
respect: as far as I can tell it's <em>always</em> the client's job
to close the connection, so any closure on the part of the server
counts as unexpected. Unless, that is, it comes after a DISCONNECT.
