More detail from an SSH packet log of a different session (same
RomSShell version string; "Foundry BigIron16 running 2.3.0aT145"):
<pre>
Outgoing packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)

<p>
Our best guess is that
<a href="http://www.allegrosoft.com/romcli.html">RomSShell</a> is having
problems with the <a href="ssh2-cbc-weakness.html">empty SSH_MSG_IGNORE</a>
that we send before each packet in CBC mode (since it's complaining after
seeing the first of these). We haven't tried making diagnostic builds to
verify this yet.
