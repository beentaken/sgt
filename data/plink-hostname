Summary: Plink using wrong hostname when one is saved in Default Settings

<p>
Since <a href="defaults-launchable.html">'defaults-launchable'</a> was
fixed, it's been possible to save a hostname in Default Settings.

<p>
However, Plink did not cope gracefully with that possibility -- it was
not possible to override that hostname on the command line. Attempts
at doing so would be treated as part of the remote command, but this
typically wouldn't be obvious as the connection wouldn't get that far.

<p>
The most common symptom of this is output like this:

<pre>C:\&gt;plink myhost.example.com
Unable to open connection:
Host does not exist</pre>

where a PuTTY connection to <tt>myhost.example.com</tt> works fine.
Upon adding the <tt>-v</tt> option you might get:

<pre>C:\&gt;plink -v myhost.example.com
Looking up host "otherhost.example.com"
Unable to open connection:
Host does not exist</pre>

which "huh?" behaviour is explained by <tt>otherhost.example.com</tt>
being in "Default Settings".
