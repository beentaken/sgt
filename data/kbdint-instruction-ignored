<p>
If we get a keyboard-interactive INFO_REQUEST with an "instruction" string but
no actual prompts, we discard the whole packet without displaying the
instruction.

<p>
SunSSH is known to send such packets when providing instructions for password
expiry and the like.

<p>
This was probably introduced around r6437, and hence probably a regression
since 0.58 (although I haven't tested it).
