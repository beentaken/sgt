Summary: Trouble with netscreen firewalls and remote command
Difficulty: taxing

<p>
Apparently when plink or PuTTY connects to a netscreen firewall with
a remote command such as "save", the session hangs after "Started
session".

<p>
Interactive connections with no command (with both plink and PuTTY)
work fine.

<p>
Some other clients (e.g. SecureCRT) are fine, but OpenSSH also has
trouble:

<p><pre>bash-2.05a# ssh 256.256.256.256 -l netscreen -v -v -v save
OpenSSH_2.9 FreeBSD localisations 20011202, SSH protocols 1.5/2.0, OpenSSL 0x0090601f
...
netscreen@257.257.257.257's password:
debug3: clear hostkey 0
debug3: clear hostkey 1
debug1: Sending command: save
debug1: Entering interactive session.
Disconnecting: protocol error: rcvd type 15
debug1: Calling cleanup 0x8059d60(0x0)</pre>

<p>
(These firewalls claim a version string of
<tt>SSH-1.5-SSH Protocol Compatible Server SCS 2.0</tt>. All
connections are therefore SSH-1.)

</ul>

<p>
We've had one report that this applies to Netscreen 4.x and previous,
but that it works fine in newer versions (as well as SSH-2).
