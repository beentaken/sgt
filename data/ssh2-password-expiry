Summary: Support for SSH-2 password expiry mechanisms
Class: semi-bug
Priority: high
Difficulty: fun

<p>
PuTTY doesn't currently support the password expiry mechanisms
represented in <code>draft-ietf-secsh-userauth-16</code> by
<code>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PASSWD_CHANGEREQ</code> et al.

<p>
Originally we weren't aware of any SSH servers which sent this
message. The following have since come to light:
<ul>
<li>Old versions of the 
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~dtucker/openssh/">OpenSSH password
expiry patches</a> used to use this mechanism, but I believe that
newer versions (including the version that was incorporated in OpenSSH
3.8) don't.
<li>VanDyke's Windows server, VShell (according to a message on IETF secsh)
<li>At least some versions of ssh.com on OpenVMS, e.g.,
<br><tt>SSH-2.0-3.2.0 SSH Secure Shell OpenVMS V5.5</tt>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-11-05:</em> this is now implemented, and partially
tested.
