Summary: rsh and rexec backends
Class: wish

There's no technical reason we shouldn't support rsh and rexec.  The only
difference between them is that rsh relies on privileged ports while
rexec passes a password.  Oh, and they run on different ports.  The
protocols are documented in the manual pages for rshd and rexecd.
