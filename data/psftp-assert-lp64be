Summary: PSFTP doesn't work on big-endian 64-bit systems

When compiled as a 64-bit application on Solaris 10, PSFTP fails on
assert (rreq == req) in file psftp.c, function do_sftp_init().  This
doesn't happen if it's compiled 32-bit.  A crude replacement of all
instances of "unsigned long" with "uint32" (equivalent to "unsigned int")
throughout psftp.c and psftp.h makes the problem go away.
