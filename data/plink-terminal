Summary: Terminal emulation in Plink
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: never
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Plink is designed as a data transport tool, and is not intended for
interactive use; as such it performs no interpretation on the data it
transfers.

<p>
However, people occasionally ask for an option in Plink to handle
terminal escape codes, so that you get `PuTTY in a console window'.

<p>
Unless there's some good reason why running PuTTY full-screen isn't
enough to address this wish, we're unlikely to consider it worth the
extra effort and code bloat.
<ul>
<li>We have actually been given one vaguely good reason: it's been
suggested that this might improve the experience of people using
screen readers. However, fixing
<a href="windows-scrollopt.html">`windows-scrollopt'</a> should have
the same effect and probably be easier.
</ul>

<p>
Perhaps it's possible to augment the Windows console with terminal
emulation capabilities &agrave; la <code>ANSI.SYS</code>?
