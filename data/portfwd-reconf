Summary: Reconfigurable port forwarding
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/plain

It would be nice to be able to reconfigure the port forwarding setup
using the Change Settings box, and have PuTTY at least attempt to
shift to the new configuration. This would involve cancelling remote
forwardings and starting new ones, closing local listening sockets
and starting new ones, so it isn't a trivial piece of work.
