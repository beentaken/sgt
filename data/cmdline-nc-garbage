From the original report:

I just have a quick bug report and patch for you.  I wasn't having any
success getting plink to work as a local proxy for putty, so I tried plink
verbosely on the command line.  The troublesome output was something like:

> plink host1 -v -nc host2:22
[...]
Access granted
Opening direct-tcpip channel to host2####:22 in place of session
Server refused to open a direct-tcpip channel
FATAL ERROR: Server refused to open a direct-tcpip channel

... where "####" was a bunch of garbage characters.  It turns out that after
the strncpy to ssh_nc_host, a '\0' is being written at the end of the entire
array, rather than at the end of the hostname.  A simple patch is attached,
against putty SVN r7683.
