Summary: Unix: "expected key exchange reply packet from server" and crash
Class: bug
Present-in: 0.54
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
We've had a couple of reports of the Unix version putting up the
"new host key" dialog, but then immediately putting up a
"PuTTY Fatal Error: expected key exchange reply packet from server"
error box over it and then crashing. I've reproduced this by
connecting to one of our correspondents' servers.

<p>
If the host key is already in the database, the connection goes
through fine. The fault doesn't appear to happen with the Windows
version, nor with Unix plink (so could be a GUI concurrency problem
due to the blocking caused by the host key verification dialog?).

<p>
Workaround: add the host key to the database first. (Apparently
this can be done by setting "close window on exit" to "never" in
the first session, or use contrib/kh2reg.py in PuTTY CVS.)

<p>
In PuTTY's SSH packet log, what appears to distinguish failing from
successful connections is that in the latter, PuTTY logs sending a
NEWKEYS before logging receiving one, whereas in the former, it
doesn't log sending one at all. So in Windows and Unix-plink
connections with and without the host key prompt, and Unix PuTTY
without the prompt, we get something like

<p><pre>Incoming packet type 31 / 0x1f (SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY)
[...]
Event Log: Host key fingerprint is:
Event Log: ssh-dss 1024 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
Outgoing packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)
Incoming packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)</pre>

<p>
whereas in Unix PuTTY with the prompt, we have

<p><pre>Incoming packet type 31 / 0x1f (SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY)
[...]
Incoming packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)
Event Log: expected key exchange reply packet from server</pre>

<p>
while waiting for the user to respond to the prompt.
