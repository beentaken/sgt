Ports to other OSes. Among the OSes we'd <em>like</em> to see PuTTY
running on are:

<ul>
<li>
Unix/X. As well as being a pure network application, it would be
particularly nice if a Unix PuTTY could have an extra back end which
ran a local shell or command in a pseudo-terminal (or indeed not in
a pseudo-terminal), making it an alternative to xterm.

<li>
MacOS. We had a port half-finished at one point, but it isn't clear
how applicable that code would be to the current state of PuTTY.

<li>
Windows CE, and/or EPOC or other PDA operating systems. Decent SSH
clients for PDAs seem to be in short supply (unless you install a
Java virtual machine and MindTerm).
</ul>
