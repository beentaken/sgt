Summary: Crashes with heavy open/close activity in port-forwarding
Content-type: text/x-html-body
Class: bug

Fixed-in: 2002-06-16 0.53
Priority: high

<p>
Apparently, if working in a terminal session at the moment a
tunnel is opened, there is a chance of causing a crash (either `Out of
memory!', or `Windows has closed PuTTY due to errors').

<p>
This tends to be noticeable when lots of port-forwarded connections
are being opened and closed (tunnelling HTTP or POP/SMTP for example).

<p>
All reports so far that have mentioned the protocol version have been
against SSH-2, with local-to-remote tunnelling. There are suggestions
that this is correlated specifically with user input rather than just
any terminal activity.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> We believe this is fixed. I (JTN) can consistently
reproduce the problem in 2002-06-05 but not 2002-06-18 (or
2002-08-19).
