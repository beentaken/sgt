If PuTTY starts up with its window unselected, something slightly
odd can happen with the cursor: it doesn't revert from box to block
when the window gains focus.

JTN, 2003-01-23: Possibly related: I've also noticed that if PuTTY
starts up without focus as a result of being run from `wf' (DoIt),
on Win2K, it doesn't get a taskbar entry until it received focus
(although it's visible on Alt-Tab).
