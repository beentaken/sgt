vnummary: Should be able to prompt for a proxy password

<p>
Currently, proxy passwords have to be stored unencrypted in the registry, or
entered manually through the setup dialogue before every session.  It should
be possible to enter them at the time the connection is set up, like other
passwords.

<p>
Note that PuTTY can make multiple connections through a proxy (for instance
for connections initiated by SSH port-forwarding). Since we may not have
a convenient channel to interact with the user at the time a proxy
connection is initiated, we'll have to prompt for the credentials before
making a connection, and cache them in memory for the duration of the
session.

<p>
Each proxied connection maps to exactly one actual network connection, and
our UI may need to reflect this. This means that if you get your password
wrong, you won't be prompted to retry (you'll have to
<a href="reuse-windows">restart the session</a> or something similar).
Similarly, we can't quietly attempt to log in without a password and then
prompt the user only when necessary; the user has to be able to specify
whether authentication should be attempted, and if it is, they
<em>will</em> be prompted.

<p>
I (JTN) have just checked all the proxy protocols we support (SOCKS4,
SOCKS5, HTTP), and I don't <em>think</em> any of them support the sending of
username but no password (as opposed to an empty password).

<p>
Therefore I think this change to the proxy authentication UI should
suffice:

<p><pre>  [x] Attempt username/password authentication

  Username: (o) prompt  ( ) use this: [abc123   ]
  Password: (o) prompt  ( ) use this: [******   ]</pre>

<p>
and would map onto proxy types as follows:
<ul>
<li>telnet: if checked, <tt>%user</tt> and <tt>%pass</tt> as specified,
   otherwise zero-length
   <br>(could be generous and only prompt for <tt>%user</tt> and
   <tt>%pass</tt> if they appear in the command string)
<li>SOCKS4/4A: if checked, username as specified, otherwise zero-length
   (ignore password always)
<li>SOCKS5: if checked, user/pass as specified, otherwise don't attempt
   auth
<li>HTTP: if checked, user/pass as specified, otherwise don't attempt
   auth (bomb out if requested?)
<li>proxy command: similar to telnet
</ul>

<p>
I guess that prompting should occur by the normal mechanism of a prompt
in the terminal window, which probably means some upheaval. Probably a
good time to implement <a href="proxy-logging">`proxy-logging'</a> too.

<p>
Legacy settings: preserve whatever the current implied behaviour turns
out to be, I guess.
