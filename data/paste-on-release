Summary: PuTTY should paste when the paste button is released
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: fun

<p>At present, PuTTY pastes text when it receives a button-down event for
whichever button is configured for paste.  Normally in Windows, actions
that are triggered by a click happen on the button-up event instead, and
moving the pointer out of the control being clicked on before the button-up
causes the action not to occur.  xterm does something slightly different, in
that it pastes on button-up, but doesn't seem to cancel if the pointer moves
outside the window.
