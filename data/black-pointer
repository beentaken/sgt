Some people have reported that PuTTY's default mouse pointer (the Windows
I-beam) appears black-on-black, and is hence invisible.  It usually consists
entirely of inverted pixels, and hence should appear white on PuTTY's default
black background.  Reports so far:

From SGT:

<p>
I've seen this same problem personally on a GeForce2MX, and I
investigated it carefully. I believe it is a bug in the GeForce2MX
video driver. The I-beam cursor is supposed to invert whatever
colour is underneath it, but it mistakenly inverts black to black.
(My suspicion is that each RGB value x is mapped to 256-x instead of
255-x, or some equally easy typo.)
<p>
Perhaps complaining to the video card manufacturer (assuming it's
them who wrote the driver) might be a good first step? I haven't
heard of anyone else who's had this problem doing so...
<p>
What I did to solve this myself was to design my own replacement
I-beam mouse pointer, which was white with a black outline so as to
show up on any kind of background. The video driver was quite happy
with that one.
