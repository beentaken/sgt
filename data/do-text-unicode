Summary: do_text() is mad in a Unicode world
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/h-html-body

<p>
The current internal interface used to draw text on screen, <code>do_text()
</code>, dates from the pre-Unicode days of PuTTY, and takes a string of
eight-bit characters in one argument, and an attribute word (including
the high-order eight bits of the Unicode characters) in another.
This is clearly mad, and <code>do_text()</code> should be passed a UCS-2
string.  This would also allow for longer strings to be passed to
<code>do_text()</code> at a time.
