Summary: Hangs on paste with middle button (Intellipoint implicated)
Class: semi-bug

<p>
I've observed the following behaviour on a colleague's machine. I
can't reproduce it myself. - JTN

<p>
PuTTY is set to paste on middle button. On this system, when the
middle button is pressed, there's a chance that the Microsoft
Intellipoint scroll pointer thing is activates (the pointer changes to
a circle containing a dot and up/down triangles, and moving the mouse
scrolls the window).

<p>
If the middle button is pressed and released quickly, there is no
deletorious effect other than the appearance of this pointer.

<p>
However, if the middle button is held and then released part-way
through a multi-line paste, the following occurs:
<ul>
<li>The pasting stops dead part-way through.
<li>PuTTY appears to "hang" - keypresses do nothing, and the mouse
pointer stays an I-beam over the title bar (normally it changes to a
proper pointer).
</ul>
<p>
Alt-Tabbing away unwedges PuTTY, although the missing pasted
characters never come through.

<p>
Could be a bug in the way we deal with press/release events?
