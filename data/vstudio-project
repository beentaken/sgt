Summary: Visual Studio project files (.DSP/.DSW)

<p>
People occasionally ask us for project/workspace (.DSP/.DSW) files to
compile PuTTY with Visual C++, or offer to contribute them.

<p>
All of our Makefiles are derived from a single upstream source
(<code>Recipe</code>) by a script (<code>mkfiles.pl</code>), so that
we don't have to maintain N slightly different Makefiles. Therefore,
any contribution would have to take the form of an update to
<code>mkfiles.pl</code> and/or <code>Recipe</code>. We won't be able
to make use of a .DSP/.DSW file per se, because that brings with it
precisely the maintenance burden we're trying to avoid.

<p>
Also, we already supply a Visual C Makefile
(<code>Makefile.vc</code>), for use with <code>nmake</code>. We're
unlikely to add .DSP/.DSW support ourselves because we don't have much
use for it.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> <code>mkfiles.pl</code> now generates these project
files. Many thanks to Joe Yates.
