Summary: Support for Mazovia character set

<p>
We've had a few requests to add a Polish character set called
"Mazovia" to the available translations.

<p>
It's also known as CP620, but Polish versions of Windows don't appear
to recognise this, so we'll have to add native support to PuTTY.

<p>
In order to do this we need a translation table from Mazovia code
points to Unicode. We're almost in a position to do this now based on
the <code>mazovia</code> translation table in
<a href="http://mikolajj.republika.pl/files/ConvertCharset/Full_ConvertCharset.zip">this ZIP file</a>, but
there are a couple of questions still to be answered:

<ul>

<li>Code point <code>0x9B</code>: corresponds to Polish currency
zloty, symbol "z&#x0142;", for which a single code point does not
exist in Unicode. Plan to map this to U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
(we're assured it's not very important).

<li>Code point <code>0xA8</code>: the character table above indicates
it's U+00BD INVERTED QUESTION MARK, but another table we've seen shows
a glyph like U+00A7 SECTION SIGN. Which is correct?

</ul>
