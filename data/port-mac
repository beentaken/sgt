<p>
There are ports to classic Mac OS and Mac OS X in progress. They're both
at the just-about-usable stage, but are a long way from release, and
things might behave unexpectedly and change without warning.

<p>
At this point, the native Mac OS X port is unlikely to be completed unless
someone else steps in to do it.
