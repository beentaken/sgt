<p>
If you have a saved session directing PuTTY to connect to a machine by
SSH but to use a port number other than 22, and then use that saved
session as the host name in a PSCP or PSFTP command line, the
non-standard port number is ignored and PSCP/PSFTP attempts to connect
to the standard SSH port 22 on the same host.
