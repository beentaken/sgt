Summary: Command-line general `-o Name=Value' type option
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body
Depends: config-locations

<p>
Ability to tweak any option via something like OpenSSH's `-o
Name=Value' option. Need to think about how to deal with complex
options like colour selection. Also, some of the existing names for
options in the Registry are inappropriate - e.g., `LinuxFunctionKeys'.
Seems dependent on wishlist item `config-locations'.
