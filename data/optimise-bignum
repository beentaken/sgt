Summary: Bignum optimisation for more x86 compilers / more processors
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: medium

sshbn.c contains conditionally-activated optimised code for x86
processors which uses 32-bit chunks instead of 16-bit ones, and a
small amount of inline assembler to force fast arithmetic with these
chunks. This makes a noticeable difference to bignum operations such
as at SSH connection setup.

We only have appropriate compiler goop for GCC/x86 currently, so this
code will only be activated on many Linux/Unix x86 builds and
MinGW/Cygwin Windows builds; in particular, it's not in our standard
Windows builds, which are done with MS Visual C.

It would be nice if we could enable the C bit of the optimisation on
more processors. In particular, it might be handy on the Mac port, if
any of the slower Mac processors can get anything out of it.
