Summary: System tray activity breaks pointer hiding
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Activity in the Windows system tray (new icons, possibly changed
icons) can cause the pointer to become spuriously unhidden when `Hide
mouse pointer when typing in a window' is checked.

<p>
We've had one report of this on Win2K (5.00.2195). I (JTN) can
reliably reproduce it at work with Win2K by sending myself mail
(Outlook adds an icon to the system tray when this happens).

<p>
<em>Update, 2004-Jul-25:</em> I was unable to reproduce the system
tray behaviour on a Win98SE system, but activity in other windows
would cause <code>WM_MOUSEMOVE</code> and <code>WM_NCMOUSEMOVE</code>
messages to be sent when nothing had actually changed. As of tomorrow's
snapshot, PuTTY will ignore such messages. Hopefully this will solve
the original problem; if it works for you it'd be nice if you could
tell us.

<p>
(Aside: the mouse pointer occasionally seems to get shown on my Win98SE
system - as a pointer, not an I-beam - and then isn't hidden by
subsequent typing. I think it may momentarily be an hourglass first.
It's sometimes caused by playing a <code>.WAV</code> file for a bell,
and sometimes happens for no apparent reason. This doesn't appear to
be visible to the usual PuTTY show/hide pointer mechanisms
(<code>show_mouseptr()</code>), so isn't fixed by the above change.)
