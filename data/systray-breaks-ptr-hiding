Summary: System tray activity breaks pointer hiding
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Activity in the Windows system tray (new icons, possibly changed
icons) can cause the pointer to become spuriously unhidden when `Hide
mouse pointer when typing in a window' is checked.

<p>
We've had one report of this on Win2K (5.00.2195). I (JTN) can
reliably reproduce it at work with Win2K by sending myself mail
(Outlook adds an icon to the system tray when this happens).
