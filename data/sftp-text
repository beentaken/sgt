Summary: Support for text conversions in SFTP
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky

<p>
The
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#A.1.10">FAQ</a>
correctly states that we don't support line-ending conversion in SFTP
(and SCP), and suggests that standardisation effort is needed.

<p>
<code>SSH_FXP_TEXT</code> has now been proposed in SFTP v4 (see
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-04.txt">draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-04</a>).
I don't know what implementations exist.
