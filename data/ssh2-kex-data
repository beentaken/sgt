Summary: Data transfer during SSH2 KEX causes confusion
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky

<p>If there is data being transferred through PuTTY while the SSH2
repeat key exchange is taking place, it can confuse some servers.
As far as I'm aware nobody has properly standardised this aspect of
the SSH2 protocol (what happens to the connection layer while the
transport layer is in a key exchange phase?) so it isn't clear what
PuTTY <em>should</em> do in this situation, but a good
conservative/liberal option would be to accept incoming
connection-layer packets provided we can decrypt them, and to queue
outgoing connection-layer packets until the key exchange is
completed. I can't easily imagine a standards decision that would
invalidate that behaviour.
