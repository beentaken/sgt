Summary: Option to use GUI dialogs for authentication

Several people have asked for password/passphrase prompts etc to
appear in dialogue boxes in Plink and/or PuTTY, rather than inlined
into the terminal output. There are a couple of good reasons you might
want to do this.

<p>
For instance, if you're using Plink with CVS but not using
passphraseless keys or Pageant, the interface for typing your password
is less than ideal (you have to find the relevant command window and
type blind into it, apparently).

<p>
Similarly if we ever get a Plink/PuTTY mode where no terminal session
is required (e.g. it's used for forwarding only).

<p>
Also, GUI popups provide some degree of assurance against spoofing
attacks; with password/passphrase prompts in the same terminal window
as everything else, it's not always easy to be sure that your password
is going where you expect, whereas a dialog box is somewhat harder
to spoof.

<p>
All optional, of course.
