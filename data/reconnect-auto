<p>
Some people would like for PuTTY to have an option to automatically
attempt to re-establish a session if it goes does unexpectedly.

<p>
We probably need to be able to <a href="disconnect.html">reliably
detect</a> when disconnections were clean or not first. We'd probably
also want to <a href="reuse-windows.html">re-use the same window</a>.

<p>
(Some people would like for us to
<a href="reconnect-remember-password.html">remember the password</a> so
they don't have to type it again, but we <em>won't</em> be doing that.)
