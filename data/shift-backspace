<p>
Perhaps Shift-Backspace could do whichever of ^H and ^? normal
Backspace <em>isn't</em> doing. Apart from anything else this would make
documentation of the Backspace functionality switch easier (we could
invite users to try Shift-Backspace if just Backspace doesn't work,
and this would be a clear indication that they needed to frob that
switch).
