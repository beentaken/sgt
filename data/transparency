<p>
A transparent, semi-transparent or alpha-blended PuTTY window. We
think this is pointless frippery and would bloat the binary to no
useful purpose. Furthermore, there are third-party utilities which
will do this for you without us needing to modify PuTTY; have a look
at
<a href="http://www.veridicus.com/tummy/programming/powermenu/">PowerMenu</a>
and also

Alternatively, on our <a href="../links.html">links page</a> is
<em>transputty</em>, a third-party hack to PuTTY.
