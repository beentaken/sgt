Summary: Transparent or translucent PuTTY window
Class: wish

<p>
A transparent, semi-transparent or alpha-blended PuTTY window. We
think this is pointless frippery and would bloat the binary to no
useful purpose.

<p>
There are third-party utilities which will do this for you without us
needing to modify PuTTY; have a look at
<a href="http://www.veridicus.com/tummy/programming/powermenu/">PowerMenu</a>
and also
<a href="http://www.chime.tv/products/glass2k.shtml">Glass2k</a>.
(Although these apparently don't keep the text opaque, which is
apparently not what people want.)

<p>
Alternatively, on our <a href="../links.html">links page</a> is
<em>transputty</em>, a third-party hack to PuTTY.
