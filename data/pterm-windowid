Summary: pterm should set WINDOWID environment variable

xterm sets the WINDOWID environment variable to the Window ID.  Since
some programs (Ian's xterm-titler program and w3m-img) use the
WINDOWID, pterm should set it too.

It looks to me like something in pterm.c needs to say something like:

windowid = GDK_WINDOW_XWINDOW(inst->window);

...and then something in pty.c can stuff that into the environment
variable.
