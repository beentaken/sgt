Summary: Allow frequently used saved sessions to be easy to access

<p>
PuTTY's inflexible alphabetical ordering of saved sessions is not
necessarily ideal if you have
<a href="many-sessions.html">more than one screenful</a> of them. You
might find that all the ones you use most often are on the second
page and you have to scroll down for them, whereas the infrequently
accessed ones are available to a single click.

<p>
You can currently fix this by renaming the sessions - I sometimes
deliberately start a session name with a zero in order to make it
appear at the top of the list - but this is far from ideal.

<p>
One possibility would simply be to allow the user to determine the
order of the saved sessions, perhaps by dragging them about or by
using some sort of Up and Down buttons.

<p>
Alternatively, someone suggested using <em>adaptive</em> ordering: a
new session is placed in the exact middle of the list, and whenever
you use a session it moves up the list by one place, so the
commonly-used ones gradually bubble up towards the top of the list.
I'm not convinced about this, but it's worth at least considering.
