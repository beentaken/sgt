Summary: Provide more useful exit codes
Class: bug
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
A common complaint is that the exit codes of various PuTTY tools on
various platforms aren't as useful as they might be.

<p>
We should review, fix, and document the exit codes of the various
PuTTY tools (ensuring we disambiguate local status from the exit code
provided by an SSH server, where applicable).
