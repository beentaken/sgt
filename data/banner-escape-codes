Summary: Interpret escape codes in pre-login banner

<p>
People occasionally ask for PuTTY to interpret escape codes in the
banner some SSH servers send prior to authentication.

<p>
The SSH-2 authentication specification,
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4252.txt">RFC 4252</a>,
states, in the section about <code>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_BANNER</code>:

<blockquote>
      If the 'message' string is displayed, control character filtering,
      discussed in [SSH-ARCH], SHOULD be used to avoid attacks by sending
      terminal control characters.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is what PuTTY does, and as such, terminal-control sequences won't
work.
