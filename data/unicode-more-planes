<p>
Currently, PuTTY only allocates 16 bits per character cell to the
Unicode code point, which only permits us to represent up to U+FFFF.
According to a correspondent (2003), "CJK users will want support for
plane 2 (and it's looking more likely that it the ideographs will
spill onto yet another plane)".

<p>
<em>Update:</em> as of the 2004-10-14 snapshot, PuTTY uses 32 bits
internally to store the code point. Platform support for copy/paste
and display has some limitations, though.
