According to a report:

When PuTTY is set up to log (printable or all session data), and the
option "Ask the user every time" is selected, two dialog boxes titled
"PuTTY Log to File" questioning whether to overwrite, append, or cancel
logging appeared.  After answering both dialog boxes, the PuTTY terminal
no longer displays incoming data.
