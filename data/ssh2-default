<p>
Version 2 of the SSH protocol has various security and other
enhancements over SSH-1. We should encourage its use.

<p>
One way of doing this is to make SSH-2 the default protocol (currently
it's SSH-1). Note that while PuTTY will fall back to SSH-1 if
necessary, this <em>is</em> potentially a user-visible change, as
if SSH-2 is chosen users will be prompted about new host keys.
(Perhaps the host key dialogue should indicate which keys we
<em>do</em> have? See also <a href="hostkey-policy.html">`hostkey-policy'</a>.)

<p>
Conversely, many upgrading users won't see this change, as it's only
the `factory default' that changes; if they've got saved settings with
SSH-1 selected then that won't change.

<p>
In future we might consider `turning off' SSH-1 by default (i.e.,
making `2 only' the default). Can't reasonably do this until SSH-2 is
practically ubiquitous.

<p>
Our documentation should probably discuss the security implications of
using SSH-1, too. (For a starting point see
<a href="http://www.snailbook.com/faq/ssh-1-vs-2.auto.html">the Snail Book FAQ</a>.)

<p>
<em>Update:</em> Even Debian stable includes SSH-2 support now, so 
we can reasonably get away with this. Fixed in snapshots.
