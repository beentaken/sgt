<p><a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/tkohno/papers/SSH/index.php">Bellare
<i>et al</i></a> describe a weakness in the use of CBC-mode ciphers in SSH2.
Section 9.2.1 of the current secsh-architecture draft suggests emitting an
SSH_MSG_IGNORE before each real packet, which I think converts Bellare
<i>et al</i>'s SSH-IPC into SSH-NPC.  Bellare <i>et al</i> suggest that that
has a weakness too, and we should pad each real packet with at least one
cipher block of random data, which would give us something equivalent to
SSH-$NPC.

<p>Implementing this in PuTTY would be fairly easy, and would give us decent
security until CTR modes are standardised.  It would, though, add something
like 32 bytes of overhead to each SSH packet in CBC mode.
