<p>
(This wish applies to SSH-2; SSH-1 doesn't provide flow control above
TCP's.)

<p>As Peter Gutmann has
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/app_sec.pdf">observed</a>,
naive implementations of the SSH-2 sliding window protocol place an arbitrary
limit on the throughput of each channel, limiting it to the product of the
window size and the round-trip time (the so-called "SSH-2 handbrake").
PuTTY is one such naive implementation (it uses a fixed channel window size
of 16k).

<p>The full generality of this problem is addressed in
<a href="flow-control.html">flow-control</a>.
A simple approach
is possible where a connection only has (and only ever will have) one channel
running over it, since in that case PuTTY can open the window fully and leave
flow control to TCP.

<p>As something of an aside, it might also be helpful for PuTTY to indicate
somehow to the server that it only plans to use a single channel on a
connection so that the server can open its window fully too.  Otherwise, we
only get improved download performance.

<p>PSCP and PSFTP do both of these as of r7679, and get decent
download performance.
