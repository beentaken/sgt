This is the README accompanying the source code to Simon Tatham's
puzzle collection.

You should find several Makefiles in the source code:

 - `Makefile' should work under GNU make on Linux, provided you have
   GTK installed to compile and link against. It builds GTK binaries
   of the puzzle games.

 - `Makefile.vc' should work under MS Visual C++ on Windows.

 - `Makefile.cyg' should work under Cygwin / MinGW. With appropriate
   tweaks and setting of TOOLPATH, it should work for both compiling
   on Windows and cross-compiling on Unix.

Each of these Makefiles builds a program called `nullgame' in
addition to the actual game binaries. This program doesn't do
anything; it's just a template for people to start from when adding
a new game to the collection, and it's compiled every time to ensure
that it _does_ compile and link successfully (because otherwise it
wouldn't be much use as a template). Once it's built, you can run it
if you really want to (but it's very boring), and then you should
ignore it.

DO NOT EDIT THE MAKEFILES DIRECTLY, if you plan to send any changes
back to the maintainer. The makefiles are generated automatically by
the Perl script `mkfiles.pl' from the file `Recipe'. If you need to
change the makefiles as part of a patch, you should change Recipe
and/or mkfiles.pl.
