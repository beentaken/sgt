 * makefile and forcibly updated every time make is run. Including it
 * here causes automake to track it as a dependency, which will cause
 * version.o to be rebuilt too.
 *
 * The space between # and include causes mkfiles.pl's dependency
 * scanner (for all other makefile types) to ignore this include,
 * which is correct because only the automake makefile passes
 * -DINCLUDE_EMPTY_H to enable it.
