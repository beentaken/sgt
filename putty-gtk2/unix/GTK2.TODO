TODO for PuTTY GTK2 port before merging back into main trunk code
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Things left to do:

 - I apparently missed out a piece of code when doing the new GTK2
   list box: shortcut activations for list boxes are missing.

 - Merge to trunk. Colin is already mentioned in the licence in all
   the branched copies, but mention him in the _website's_ licence
   page too.
