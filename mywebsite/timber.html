<h1>Timber: A New Mail User Agent</h1>

<p>
This is a page about Timber, a new mail user agent which I'm
currently in the process of writing.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>(or, <i>Why Yet Another MUA?</i>)

<p>
I'm working on Timber for the usual reason people want to write yet
another of something: none of the existing MUAs quite do what I
want.

<p>
Three or so years ago, I finally got sick of the MUA I had been
using up until then,
<a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">Pine</a>,
for the simple reason that I'd become a very proficient user of the
Emacs-like text editor
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/~davis/jed/">Jed</a>
and I didn't like having to downgrade my editing reflexes when I was
writing e-mail. I wanted an MUA embedded in Jed, so I'd have the
same editing environment, and better still I'd be able to dash off a
quick e-mail in the middle of a long editing session.

<p>Unfortunately, there weren't any MUAs written in Jed, or at least
none that were much good; so I wrote my own. It ran mostly inside
Jed, with a few Perl scripts to help it do system-access things. Its
usage model was largely derived from Pine, because that was what I
was used to: you had an Inbox, and some Folders, and when you'd read
each mail you could save it into a Folder.

<p>
I called it Timber, whimsically, because it heralded the fall of
Pine. (From my own perspective, at least.)

<p>
Timber v0 never made it out into the world. It's not production
quality software, and more sort of <i>symbiosisware</i>: it has a
lot of bits missing, and when I run across a missing bit, I decide
whether it's easier to implement it or to live without it.

<p>
Three years on, I'm getting heartily sick of Timber v0 for a variety
of reasons. Partly, it's far too slow (being written in the
interpreted language
<a href="http://www.s-lang.org/">S-Lang</a>),
and partly I'm getting annoyed with the underlying folder model.
It's time for a rewrite, in a proper fast compiled language. Timber
v2.

<p>
(Yes, I'm going to go straight from v0 to v2. So what?)

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
Timber v2 will feature two big design concepts which I keep getting
annoyed at the lack of in Timber v0, and in Pine, and in pretty much
anything else I've seen. They are: <em>threading</em> and
<em>categories</em>.

<p>
Recently I've been trying (with notable lack of success) to plough
through a backlog of several hundred e-mails which I've built up.
Many of those mails are sent to the
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
maintainer alias, which means they've been seen by the other members
of the PuTTY core team. Quite a few of them have already been
answered by other team members. So working through the backlog from
the beginning is a confusing job, because I might easily reply to a
message and then realise somebody else has replied to it already, a
lot further down the folder, and I hadn't noticed. A threaded mailer
would solve this, because each message would automatically be
grouped together with any existing replies.

<p>
The other big thing, categories, is a concept designed to replace
folders. Folders are a means of <em>storing</em> mail: you move your
message out of the Inbox, into a folder, and it stays in that
folder. Any mail not in a folder doesn't exist at all. In Timber,
all mail will be stored in one large heap, and categories will
be a means of <em>indexing</em> the mail. So a message can be in
multiple categories, without actually storing multiple copies of the
message; and conversely, a message can be in no categories at all
and still exist. So when I get a message from John about PuTTY, I
don't have to decide whether to file it under "John" or under
"PuTTY", and when I come back to look at it in the future, I don't
have to try and remember which one I chose. I can file it under
<em>both</em>. No more problem.

<p>
Filing messages in multiple categories sounds like a lot of work for
the user: if it's a pain trying to think of <em>one</em> good place
to file each message you get, it must be much worse to try to think
of several! To try to alleviate that, there will be some degree of
<em>automatic</em> categorisation. For one thing, every person
listed in your address book will automatically have an associated
category - so you can immediately see every mail you have on file
which was sent to or from that person. In addition, there will be a
configurable mechanism whereby you can automatically assign
categories to incoming messages by recognising things about them.
For example, messages with a <tt>List-Id:</tt> header describing a
particular mailing list might automatically be filed in the category
for that mailing list. (And note that mailing lists can be read
almost exactly like newsgroups, because Timber will be threaded.)

<p>
Other features I plan to add include:

<ul>
<li>
Good support for character set handling. Timber v0 has no
understanding at all of character sets; it's just about competent to
decode a quoted-printable or base64 encoded text part in a message,
but if the decoded text isn't in the same character set as my
terminal, then I have to make my own guess at what it's supposed to
say. Timber v2 will include a reasonably comprehensive character set
conversion library, and will automatically perform all necessary
conversions (including decoding RFC 2047 mail headers) so that the
message appearing on my screen will be the best representation my
terminal can generate of what the sender intended. In particular, it
is prepared to deal with people using the Windows-1252 quote
characters in mail claiming to be ISO-8859-1.
<li>
The surprisingly useful "queue" function: you compose a message,
state a date and time, and the message is delayed until that time
before being sent. I often use this to send myself reminders of
things, but also I find it very handy in PuTTY development: a
snapshot is built from the sources every night, so if I fix a bug
one day then I can send a time-delayed reply to the reporter saying
"please try today's snapshot", which doesn't go out until the
following day after the snapshot has built. (Of course, this fails
if the snapshot build doesn't happen for some reason. Perhaps I'll
build in a safeguard mechanism, so that you can require a command to
be run which must return success for the mail to be sent.)
<li>
I'd like to build in integration with GPG, although planning is only
at a very early stage as yet.
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>
In order to embed this MUA in my editor but still have it run fast,
I'm writing a C back end which speaks a simple text protocol. Then
I'll write a front end in S-Lang, which will invoke the Timber back
end every time it needs to perform an operation on the mail store.
So I'll have all the speed of the C back end, with all the
convenience of the Jed front end. And better still, it'll be
possible to write alternative front ends just as easily: Timber
embedded in Emacs, Timber as a stand-alone Unix console application,
Timber as an X or GTK application, and so on. In particular, one
person is already interested in writing a GUI front end for Mac OS
X.

<p>
It will also be possible to invoke the back end directly from the
command line; and in fact it's entirely possible that I won't bother
to implement some of the less commonly used functions of Timber in
the Jed front end at all, so they'll have to be invoked from the
command line. Examples include retrieving a specific message, or a
whole category, and exporting it in mbox format; importing mail from
an external mbox; performing full-text searches over all or part of
your mail; and other useful things. In particular, the command-line
utility will also support hands-off <em>sending</em> of mail; you'll
be able to use it in scripts, in place of <tt>mailx</tt> or
<tt>/usr/lib/sendmail</tt>, and have a copy of the message
automatically filed in the database and indexed in a given set of
categories.

<p>
The mail storage architecture comes in two parts. Firstly, a "mail
store", which is where actual messages are held; and secondly, an
index database which stores all the information about categories,
all the details of senders and recipients and message IDs, the
subjects and dates of the messages, and anything else to which
efficient access is required. The idea is that when generating an
index of messages to be displayed on the screen, only the
information in the index database should be needed, and the MUA
should not have to retrieve the full text of any actual message
until the user specifically says they want to <em>read</em> that
particular message.

<p>
I had initially planned to have the index database store the full
text of the messages as well as index data, but decided this was a
silly idea for two major reasons. Firstly, if the mail store is in a
simple text format (in the initial version of Timber it will be a
set of text files in the ordinary Unix mbox format), this guarantees
that if the index database becomes corrupt and unusable, you can
still recover all your mail and shovel it into another MUA without
too much difficulty. Secondly, separating the mail store from the
index opens up the possibility of changing the mail store at a later
date; in particular, one thing that might be useful is to support
IMAP as the mail store while retaining the index database. (This
would lose the major advantage of IMAP that you can access your mail
from anywhere; but for some IMAP users this isn't a particular
concern, and if a site policy forces them to store their mail on an
IMAP server then they might appreciate Timber's use of a locally
stored index to speed up their mail operations and keep IMAP
requests to a minimum.)

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
Timber v2 was nothing but vapourware for some time. My requirement
for a database was the sticking point: most database software I'm
aware of follows a client/server model, where the database server
must be installed systemwide and the sysadmin needs to intervene to
allow a given user to put any data in it. This seemed like a silly
requirement for an MUA: if Timber were to see widespread uptake,
then on a large multi-user Unix system the sysadmin might have to
individually set up a database area for many of the users to each
run Timber in.

<p>
What I really needed was a database which was implemented as a
library: something I could link into a user-level process and have
it give me efficient data storage, locking and transactions simply
by accessing a disk file and using file-locking system calls, with
no need to ask the sysadmin to do anything at all. I spent a lot of
planning time on trying to figure out how to write one from scratch,
but without any database coding experience it looked like being a
long job and I never started it.

<p>
Late in 2003, someone brought
<a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/">SQLite</a>
to my attention. This appeared, both at first sight and on closer
inspection, to be <em>exactly</em> what I'd been looking for. I
played with it a bit and nothing made me doubt this; so the major
obstacle to Timber development was removed and I got started in
earnest.

<p>
As I write this in January 2004, the bottom layers of Timber - mail
storage and retrieval, parsing and indexing, character-set
translation, and encoding of messages for sending - are well under
way. The high-level layers such as threading and categories, address
book management, and non-command-line front ends, have yet to get
started.
