<h1 align=center>Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This page contains a collection of small computer programs which
implement one-player puzzle games. All of them run natively on
Unix (GTK), on Windows, and on Mac OS X.

<p>
I wrote this collection because I thought there should be more small
desktop toys available: little games you can pop up in a window and
play for two or three minutes while you take a break from whatever
else you were doing. And I was also annoyed that every time I found
a good game on (say) Unix, it wasn't available the next time I was
sitting at a Windows machine, or vice versa; so I arranged that
everything in my personal puzzle collection will happily run on
both. When I find (or perhaps invent) further puzzle games that I
like, they'll be added to this collection and will immediately be
available on both platforms. And if anyone feels like writing any
other front ends - Mac OS pre-10, PocketPC, or whatever it might be
- then all the games in this framework will immediately become
available on another platform as well.

<h2>The games</h2>

The actual games in this collection were mostly not my invention; I
saw them elsewhere, and rewrote them in a form that was more
convenient for me. I do not claim credit, in general, for inventing
the rules of any of these puzzles; all I claim is authorship of the
code.

to get all six blue squares on the faces of the cube at once. Count
your moves and try to do it in as few as possible. Then try it on a
triangular grid with any of a tetrahedron, an octahedron or an
icosahedron.

<h2 style="clear: both">Licence</h2>

This game collection is copyright 2004-2005 Simon Tatham. It is all
distributed under the
<a href="doc/licence.html#licence">MIT licence</a>.
This means that you can do pretty much anything you like with the
game binaries or the code, except pretending you wrote them
yourself, or suing me if anything goes wrong.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Here are Windows executables of the puzzle games in the
collection. (On Windows only, the Net executable is called
"<code>netgame.exe</code>" in order to avoid clashing with Windows's
own "<code>net.exe</code>". The name of the <em>game</em> is still
"Net" :-)

<p>Here is a Windows help file (and its accompanying contents file).
If you install these in the same directory as the executable files,
then each game should display a "Help" menu giving help about the
game collection in general and that game in particular. You can also
browse the same documentation
<a href="doc/">online in HTML format</a>.

<p>Here is a Mac OS X disk image file, containing a single
monolithic application called "Puzzles". You should be able to
download and open the disk image, then drag the Puzzles application
to wherever you feel like keeping it; it should be entirely
self-contained. (However, it is also the first Mac OS X application
I've ever written, so I can't make any guarantees! Let me know if
you have any trouble with it and I'll try to fix it.)

<p>Here is a source archive of the collection, which should allow
you to compile the games on any Unix system supporting GTK. (At
least, I hope so; I've only tested it on Linux so far, and I
wouldn't rule out portability issues on other types of Unix.)

You might find it helpful to read

before reporting a bug.

<p>
Patches are welcome. Especially if they provide a new front end (to
make all these games run on another platform), or a new game.
