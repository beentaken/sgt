<h1>Tweak: an efficient hex editor</h1>

<p>
Tweak is a hex editor. It allows you to edit a file at very low
level, letting you see the full and exact binary contents of the
file. It can be useful for modifying binary files such as
executables, editing disk or CD images, debugging programs that
generate binary file formats incorrectly, and many other things.

<p>
Tweak currently runs on Unix, using the <code>ncurses</code> library
to run in a terminal.

<h2>Why yet another hex editor?</h2>

<p>
Tweak uses a complex data structure based on B-trees, designed to
make almost all editing operations extremely fast, even when they
are working on huge amounts of data.

<p>
The data structure is
<a href="btree.html">described in detail</a> on a separate page for
those interested. The bottom line is:

<ul>
<li>
Tweak supports insert mode (not particularly useful if you're
editing an executable file or a filesystem image, but can be
extremely handy in other file formats such as PNG).
<li>
Cutting, copying and pasting within the file you are editing is
extremely efficient. No matter how big the chunk of data you are
moving around - even if it's a 200Mb section of a CD image - Tweak
will always perform the operation effectively instantly.
<li>
Tweak supports lazy loading of the input file: rather than sucking
it all into memory straight away, it simply remembers which parts of
the editing buffer are copies of which parts of the input file and
refers to the file on disk when it needs to. Tweak only has to take
significant time when you genuinely need it to read the entire file.
The <em>only</em> two operations with this property are searching,
and saving the modified version of the file to disk. Everything else
is instant.
</ul>

<p>
You might think, from reading this, that the entire purpose of
publishing Tweak was to show off my shiny data structure. You would
be right :-)

<h2>What is its current status?</h2>

<p>
The current public release, Tweak 3.01, is available as a source
tarball here:

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>
<a href="tweak-3.01.tar.gz">tweak-3.01.tar.gz</a>
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can read its <code>man</code> page <a
href="manpage-3.01.html">online</a>.

<p>
If you want to see the latest state of development, you can check
the development sources out from my Subversion repository.

<p>
The Subversion URL you need for Tweak is
<code>svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/tweak</code>. You will also need
two source files <code>btree.c</code> and <code>btree.h</code>,
which are in a different directory called <code>library</code>. So to check
out all the code necessary to build Tweak, you would need commands
such as this:
<pre><code>svn co svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/tweak
svn co svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/library
ln -s ../library/btree.c tweak
ln -s ../library/btree.h tweak</code></pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you can browse the Subversion repository on the WWW,
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon-anonsvn/viewcvs.cgi/tweak/">here</a>.
