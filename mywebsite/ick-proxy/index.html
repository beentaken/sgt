<p align=center><i>a disgusting cross-browser URL rewriting tool</i>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<code>ick-proxy</code> is a utility which works with your web
browser to rewrite specified kinds of URL before you visit them. For
example, you could use it to ensure that whenever you follow a
link to a
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News</a>
article, you always see it in the high-graphics version (with
"<code>/hi/</code>" in the URL) even if the link you followed was
actually to the low-graphics version (with "<code>/low/</code>"). Or
vice versa.

<p>
Other tools exist to do this type of job for particular web
browsers.
<code>ick-proxy</code>
is the only one I know of which is not specific to a single web
browser.

<p>
However, the mechanism by which it does so is utterly disgusting
(hence its name). Briefly, it implements a custom web proxy which
forges HTTP 302 redirections for any URL that needs rewriting, and
provides your browser with a
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/web-browser-auto-proxy-configuration.html">Proxy Auto-Configuration</a>
file which ensures that only URLs requiring rewriting are sent to
that proxy. It does all this at the direction of a configuration
script written in a small custom-designed language. For more
details, see the documentation (links given below).

<p>
In spite of the sheer unpleasantness of this design, however, it
seems to be basically robust: I have been running versions of it
myself since 2004 and it's never caused me any trouble.

<p>
<code>ick-proxy</code>
runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix.

<p>Caveats:
<ul>
<li>The user configuration for
<code>ick-proxy</code>
is written as a program, in a C-like programming language.
Therefore, in order to use
<code>ick-proxy</code>
at all, you need to either be able to program or be able to persuade
someone else to write your configuration for you.
<li>I have personally got
<code>ick-proxy</code>
to work with
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>,
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a>
and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>.
I have not got it to work with
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer</a>,
although I don't know for sure that it's impossible. I would welcome
a more thorough investigation of this.
</ul>

If you want to see the latest state of development, you can check
the development sources out from my Subversion repository.

<p>
The Subversion URL you need is
<code>svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/ick-proxy</code>. So you could use a
checkout command such as this:
<pre><code>svn co svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/ick-proxy</code></pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you can browse the Subversion repository on the WWW,
<a href="http://svn.tartarus.org/ick-proxy/">here</a>.

<p>
You might find it helpful to read
<a href="../bugs.html">this article</a>
before reporting a bug.

<p>
Patches are welcome.

<p>
Also welcome (as mentioned above) would be any reports on whether or
not
<code>ick-proxy</code>
works with MS Internet Explorer. I didn't manage to get it to work
myself, but I only tried briefly, and it's entirely possible that
the problem was me not configuring IE correctly. I would welcome a
definitive report on whether or not it works, and how to set it up
if it does.
