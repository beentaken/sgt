<p align=center><i>a URL-launching tool for Windows</i>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
A lot of Windows programs these days offer the ability to click on a
URL and automatically have your web browser bring up a window
showing that URL. However, not nearly all of them do. If an
application that doesn't support this is showing a URL you want to
look at, your only option is to use the Windows cut and paste
facility to copy the URL to the clipboard, then launch your browser,
and then paste the URL into that.

<p>
WinURL tries to make this process a little bit easier. Instead of
having to launch your browser and then paste, you can just click
once on the WinURL icon in the System tray, and WinURL will read the
contents of the clipboard and feed them straight to your browser. So
you need only select a URL in the source application, hit Copy, and
click on WinURL.

<p>
In some applications (perhaps an IRC client, or a terminal emulator)
the URL may be wrapped across several lines, so that copying and
pasting it into your browser might not even work because of newline
and space characters in the middle. WinURL will strip those out
automatically, so that copying a URL out of a terminal emulator can
be just as easy as copying it out of anything else.

<h2>Installing and using WinURL</h2>

<p>
To install WinURL, just download one of the archives below, and
put the executable file <code>winurl.exe</code> somewhere where you
won't lose it. To start WinURL running, just double-click on the
executable file (no command-line options are required).
Alternatively, you might want to put a shortcut to it in the Startup
section of your Start menu, so that it will always be running
whenever you use your computer.

<p>
When WinURL is running, it will put its icon in the System tray. If
you left-click on this icon, WinURL will read the contents of the
clipboard, treat it as a URL, and launch that URL. Right-clicking on
the same icon will produce a small menu which lets you shut down
WinURL.

<p>
Currently, WinURL also registers the hot key Windows-W, which you
can press anywhere and it will have the same effect as left-clicking
on the WinURL icon.

<p>
It's that simple.
