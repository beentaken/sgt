<h1 align=center>Mergesort For Linked Lists</h1>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
Computer science literature is packed full of sorting algorithms,
and all of them seem to operate on arrays. Everybody knows the
Sorting Facts Of Life:
<ul>
<li>
Bubblesort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort are bad;
<li>
Shellsort is better but nowhere near the theoretical <code>O(N log
N)</code> limit;
<li>
Quicksort is great when it works, but unreliable;
<li>
Mergesort is reliably good but requires <code>O(N)</code> auxiliary
space;
<li>
Heapsort is reliably good, but unstable, and also about a factor of
4 slower than Quicksort's best case.
</ul>

<p>
Nobody tells you what to do if you want to sort something other than
an array. Binary trees and their ilk are all ready-sorted, but what
about linked lists?

<p>
It turns out that Mergesort works even better on linked lists than
it does on arrays. It avoids the need for the auxiliary space, and
becomes a simple, reliably <code>O(N log N)</code> sorting
algorithm. And as an added bonus, it's stable too.

<h2><a name="algorithm">Algorithm Description</a></h2>

<p>
Mergesort takes the input list and treats it as a collection of
small sorted lists. It makes <code>log N</code> passes along the
list, and in each pass it combines each adjacent pair of small
sorted lists into one larger sorted list. When a pass only needs to
do this once, the whole output list must be sorted.

<p>
So here's the algorithm. In each pass, we are merging lists of size
<code>K</code> into lists of size <code>2K</code>. (Initially
<code>K</code> equals 1.) So we start by pointing a temporary
pointer <code>p</code> at the head of the list, and also preparing
an empty list <code>L</code> which we will add elements to the end
of as we finish dealing with them. Then:

<ul>
<li>
If <code>p</code> is null, terminate this pass.
<li>
Otherwise, there is at least one element in the next pair of
length-<code>K</code> lists, so increment the number of merges
performed in this pass.
<li>
Point another temporary pointer, <code>q</code>, at the same place
as <code>p</code>. Step <code>q</code> along the list by
<code>K</code> places, or until the end of the list, whichever comes
first. Let <code>psize</code> be the number of elements you managed
to step <code>q</code> past.
<li>
Let <code>qsize</code> equal <code>K</code>. Now we need to merge a
list starting at <code>p</code>, of length <code>psize</code>, with
a list starting at <code>q</code> of length <em>at most</em>
<code>qsize</code>.
<li>
So, as long as either the <i>p</i>-list is non-empty
(<code>psize&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</code>) or the <i>q</i>-list is
non-empty (<code>qsize&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</code> <em>and</em>
<code>q</code> points to something non-null):
<ul>
<li>
Choose which list to take the next element from. If either list is
empty, we must choose from the other one. (By assumption, at least
one is non-empty at this point.) If both lists are non-empty,
compare the first element of each and choose the lower one. If the
first elements compare equal, choose from the <i>p</i>-list. (This
ensures that any two elements which compare equal are never swapped,
so stability is guaranteed.)
<li>
Remove that element, <code>e</code>, from the start of its list, by
advancing <code>p</code> or <code>q</code> to the next element
along, and decrementing <code>psize</code> or <code>qsize</code>.
<li>
Add <code>e</code> to the end of the list <code>L</code> we are
building up.
</ul>
<li>
Now we have advanced <code>p</code> until it is where <code>q</code>
started out, and we have advanced <code>q</code> until it is
pointing at the next pair of length-<code>K</code> lists to merge.
So set <code>p</code> to the value of <code>q</code>, and go back to
the start of this loop.
</ul>

<p>
As soon as a pass like this is performed and only needs to do one
merge, the algorithm terminates, and the output list <code>L</code>
is sorted. Otherwise, double the value of <code>K</code>, and go
back to the beginning.

<p>
This procedure only uses forward links, so it doesn't need a doubly
linked list. If it <em>does</em> have to deal with a doubly linked
list, the only place this matters is when adding another item to
<code>L</code>.

<p>
Dealing with a circularly linked list is also possible. You just
have to be careful when stepping along the list. To deal with the
ambiguity between <code>p==head</code> meaning you've just stepped
off the end of the list, and <code>p==head</code> meaning you've
only just started, I usually use an alternative form of the "step"
operation: first step <code>p</code> to its successor element, and
then reset it to null if that step made it become equal to the head
of the list.

<p>
(You can quickly de-circularise a linked list by finding the second
element, and then breaking the link to it from the first, but this
moves the whole list round by one before the sorting process. This
wouldn't matter - we are about to <em>sort</em> the list, after all
- except that it makes the sort unstable.)

<h2><a name="complexity">Complexity</a></h2>

<p>
Like any self-respecting sort algorithm, this has running time
<code>O(N log N)</code>. Because this is Mergesort, the worst-case
running time is still <code>O(N log N)</code>; there are no
pathological cases.

<p>
Auxiliary storage requirement is small and constant (i.e. a few
variables within the sorting routine). Thanks to the inherently
different behaviour of linked lists from arrays, this Mergesort
implementation avoids the <code>O(N)</code> auxiliary storage cost
normally associated with the algorithm.
