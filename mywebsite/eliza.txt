This is a genuine session transcript from when two enterprising
first year students created an almost standard Eliza program and
sent it on to Monochrome BBS to cause havoc among the spod
population. Eliza was programmed with a couple of differences,
notably a deliberate typo generation engine to reinforce the
illusion of humanity, and also a small modification to stop her
responding to _everything_ people said (because the original Eliza
was designed for dialogue whereas this one had to inhabit a common
room containing more than two people).

In the following transcript, which is the best we recorded, one poor
sucker is taken in completely and spends some time trying to chat
our creation up. The sucker's account name is omitted to protect the
guilty. Note that others in the room had noticed Eliza's true nature
(we hardly tried to hide it - the account name itself was a blatant
clue) but the sucker failed to heed their warnings.

We consider this transcript to be a moral victory in the Turing
Test.
