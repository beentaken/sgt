<p>
My model of Amble the panda was the first picture I tried to
<em>draw</em> on the surface of a dodecahedron. Generating the globe
required no drawing, just software: it was a matter of stringing
together a long line of mechanical data processing utilities (some
of which I had to write myself) to convert some pre-supplied data
into the right format. Amble, by contrast, required me to do actual
graphic design and artwork.

<p>
Lacking any particularly sensible way to draw directly on the
surface of a sphere, I decided the simplest approach would be to
take advantage of the fact that Amble is mostly plain white, with
only a few small black markings (paws, ears, tail, facial features).
So I drew each of those markings separately in an ordinary Euclidean
drawing package, and then projected each one on to the appropriate
area of the spherical image.

<p>
The drawing package I picked was
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a>,
mostly because it was already conveniently available on my Debian
system. Dia isn't really ideally suited to artwork of this type,
being more designed for box-and-line diagrams, but it does have a
general B&#233;zier curve tool, so I just about coped. With
hindsight, I might have tried
<a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>
instead, but I hadn't heard of it at the time.

<p>
So I drew a number of small pictures in Dia, representing Amble's
face, hand and ear, tail and foot.

<img src="amble-e.png" border=0>

<p>
Having done that, I then had to import those images into my
spherical image mechanism. This involved writing a script which read
the Dia file format and generated a fragment of PostScript I could
feed to the projection engine I'd already written for the
<a href="globe.html">globe</a>.


<p>
Dia's file format is <code>gzip</code>ped XML. This made it fairly
easy to read, since the nice thing about XML is that you don't have
to understand the entire format in order to parse it basically
successfully and extract just the bits you need. So I wrote a Python
script which read in a Dia file and extracted the coordinates of all
the lines, B&#233;zier curves and so on, then projected them into
spherical coordinates and converted them into PostScript.

<p>
One important part of this process was to flatten B&#233;zier curves
into sequences of straight lines. There's no particularly sensible
definition of a B&#233;zier curve on a sphere, and even if there
were, it wouldn't be exactly the same as what you get from
projecting the control points on to a plane and drawing the
resulting curve. This wouldn't matter for a curve contained entirely
within one face of the polyhedron, but if a curve crosses a face
boundary then I needed to be sure the two halves would match up
exactly at the boundary. Straight lines (or, more accurately, great
circle arcs) do give this guarantee, since the gnomonic projection
of a great circle is given by intersecting the solid with a plane
passing through the origin and the line, and hence joins up
correctly when the projection surface changes direction.

<p>
So my final artwork and processing framework for the Amble picture
ended up consisting of several Dia files, and a Python script; that
script, as well as containing the general code to convert Dia into
spherical-image data, also contains the Amble-specific information
about what Dia files exist and what parts of the sphere to project
them on to. (Some of the above pictures were projected twice on to
opposite sides of the sphere, once in mirror image. This saved me
having to draw each paw and ear twice by hand.)

<p>
This was a thoroughly ad-hoc way to do anything, but it worked well
enough, and in fact it worked well enough that I was able to adapt
the same technique to my subsequent models of
<a href="badger.html">a badger</a>
and
<a href="eek.html">Eek! the bat</a>.
