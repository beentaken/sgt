<p>
Making a colour cube is kind of an obvious thing to do if you're
looking around for interesting or significant things to draw on the
surface of a polyhedron.

<p>
For anyone who doesn't already understand the concept: a colour on a
computer is generally represented using three numbers giving the
intensities of red, green and blue light that make up the colour. An
obvious way to plot these in a graphical representation is to assign
one to each of the three coordinates in 3-D space, which gives you a
notional cube in which every point represents a different colour.
For more information (and links to far more detail than you could
reasonably want), see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">Wikipedia</a>.

<p>
Of course, most of the available colours are in the
<em>interior</em> of the colour cube, but a model of this type can
only show the surface. But that's OK; all the most vivid colours are
on the surface, so that's the part that looks the prettiest!

<p>
Much like the construction of the
<a href="dodec-cubes.html">cube-marked dodecahedron</a>,
this project was most simply done by hand-writing a picture
description file which defined a load of small filled rectangles in
3-D space, and made sure the locations of those rectangles matched
up to the cube.

<p>
When I came to print it, it turned out that it's quite a demanding
test of a colour printer, and shows up interesting features of its
colour response which you might not have expected. On my printer,
for example, there's a clearly visible part of the surface of the
cube which looks like a particularly pure cyan &#8211; but it's not
at what ought to be the cyan corner of the cube. Instead, it's
part-way along one edge from that corner. Presumably the printer is
doing some sort of non-trivial internal processing when translating
PostScript <code>setrgbcolor</code> commands into CMYK.
