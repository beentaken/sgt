Bug files have the basic format of RFC-822 mail messages, but without any
of the semantics of particular headers specified by the RFC.  Instead,
the following headers are defined:

  Written in plain text.

Class:
  One of:
    vulnerability  This is a security vulnerability.
    bug		This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.
    semi-bug	This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise
		definition of what a bug is.
    wish	This is a request for an enhancement.

Priority:
  One of:
    high	This should be fixed in the next release.
    medium	This should be fixed one day.
    low		We aren't sure whether to fix this or not.
    never	We don't ever intend to fix this.

Difficulty:
  One of:
    fun		Just needs tuits, and not many of them.

  Present-in.
