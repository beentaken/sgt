<p>
Anybody who has written software for a less capable computer user
will probably have received at least one bad bug report. Reports
which say nothing ("It doesn't work!"); reports which make no sense;
reports which don't give enough information; reports which give
<em>wrong</em> information. Reports of problems which turn out to
be user error; reports of problems which turn out to be the fault of
somebody else's program; reports of problems which turn out to be
network failures.

<p>
There's a reason why technical support is seen as a horrible job to
be in, and bad bug reports like these are it. But not all of them
are: I maintain free software, when I'm not earning my living, and
sometimes I receive wonderfully clear, helpful, <em>informative</em>
bug reports. It can be done; very few people do it.

<p>
In this essay I'll try to state clearly what makes a good bug
report. Ideally I would like everybody in the world to read this
essay before reporting any bugs to anybody. Certainly I would like
everybody who reports bugs to <em>me</em> to have read it.

<p>
When you report a bug, you are doing so because <em>you</em> want
the bug fixed. There is no point in swearing at the programmer or
being deliberately unhelpful: it may be their fault and your
problem, and you might be right to be angry with them, but the bug
<em>will</em> get fixed faster if you supply all the information they
need.
</p>

<a name="showme"><h3>"Show me."</h3></a>

<p>
One of the very best ways you can report a bug is by showing it to
the programmer. Stand they in front of your computer, fire up their
software, and <em>demonstrate</em> the thing that goes wrong. Let
them watch you start the machine, watch you run the software, watch
how you interact with the software, and watch what the software does
in response to your inputs.

<p>
They <em>know</em> that software like the back of their hand. They know
which parts they trust, and they know which parts are likely to have
faults. They know intuitively what to watch for. By the time the
software does something obviously wrong, they might well already
have noticed something <em>subtly</em> wrong earlier which might
give them a clue. They get to observe <em>everything</em> the
computer does during the test run, and they can pick out the
important bits for themselves.

<p>
It might not be enough. They might decide they need more
information. They might ask you to show him the same thing again.
They might ask you to talk <em>them</em> through the procedure, so
that they can reproduce the bug for themselves as many times as they
want. They might try varying the procedure a few times, to see
whether the problem occurs in only one case or in a family of
related cases. If you're unlucky, they might need to sit down for a
couple of hours with a set of development tools and <em>really</em>
start investigating. But the most important thing is to get the
programmer to be looking at the computer when it goes wrong. Once
they can <em>see</em> the problem happening, they can take it from
there and start trying to fix it.
</p>

<a name="showmehow"><h3>"Show me how to show myself."</h3></a>

<p>
This is the era of the Internet. This is the era of worldwide
communication. This is the era in which I can send my software to
somebody in Russia at the touch of a button, and he can send me
comments about it just as easily. If he has a problem with my
program, he <em>can't</em> have me standing in front of it while it
fails. "Show me" is good when you can do it, but often you can't.

<p>
If you have to report a bug to a programmer who can't be present in
person, the aim of the exercise is to get them to <em>reproduce</em>
the problem. You want the programmer to run their own copy of the
program, do the same things to it, and make it fail in the same way.
Then they can see the problem happening in front of their eyes, and
then they can deal with it.

<p>
So tell them <em>exactly what you did</em>. If it's a graphical
program, tell them which buttons you pressed and what order you
pressed them in. If it's a program you run by typing a command, show
them precisely what command you typed.

<p>
Give them all the input you can think of. If the program reads from
a file, you will probably need to send them a copy of the file. If
the program talks to another computer over a network, you probably
can't send them a copy of that computer, but you can at least tell
them what kind of computer it is, and (if you can) what software is
running on it.
</p>

<a name="describe"><h3>"Works for me. So what goes wrong?"</h3></a>

<p>
If you give the programmer a long list of inputs and actions, and
they fire up their own copy of the program and nothing goes wrong,
then you haven't given them enough information. Possibly the fault
doesn't show up on every computer; your system and theirs may differ
in some way. Possibly you have misunderstood what the program is
supposed to do, and you are both looking at exactly the same display
but you think it's wrong and they know it's right.

<p>
So <em>describe</em> what happened. Tell them exactly what you saw.
Tell them why you think what you saw is wrong; better still, tell
them exactly what you expected to see. If you say "and then it went
wrong", you have left out some very important information.

<p>
Tell the programmer, carefully and precisely, any error messages you
got. They <em>are</em> important! At this stage, the programmer is
not trying to <em>fix</em> the problem: they're trying to <em>find</em>
it. They need to know what has gone wrong, and those error messages
are the computer's best effort to <em>say</em> what has gone wrong.
Write the errors down if you have no other easy way to remember
them, but don't report that the program generated an error if you're
not also able to report what the error message was.

<p>
In particular, if the error message has numbers in it, <em>do</em>
let the programmer have those numbers. Just because you can't see
any meaning in them doesn't mean there isn't any. Numbers contain
all kinds of information that can be read by programmers, and they
are likely to contain vital clues. Numbers in error messages are
like a message in a bottle. They are the information the computer
throws out when everything has gone too wrong for it to recover.

<p>
At this stage, the programmer is doing <em>detective work</em>. They
don't know what's happened, and they can't get close enough to watch
it happening for himself, so they is searching for clues that might
give it away. Error messages, incomprehensible strings of numbers,
and even unexplained delays are all just as important as
fingerprints at the scene of a crime. Don't throw them away.
</p>

<a name="antelope"><h3>"So then I tried . . ."</h3></a>

<p>
There are a lot of things you might do when an error or bug comes
up. Many of them make the problem worse. A friend of mine at school
deleted all her Word documents by mistake, and before calling in any
expert help, the first thing she tried was reinstalling Word, and
the second thing she tried was running Defrag. Neither of these
helped recover her files, and between them they scrambled her disk
to the extent that no Undelete program in the world would have been
able to recover anything. If she'd only left it alone, she might
have had a chance.

<p>
Users like this are like a mongoose backed into a corner: with its
back to the wall and seeing certain death staring it in the
face, it attacks rabidly because doing something <em>has</em> to be
better than doing nothing. This is not well adapted to the type of
problems computers produce.

<p>
Instead of being a mongoose, be an antelope. When an antelope is
confronted with something unexpected or frightening, it
<em>freezes</em>. It stays absolutely still and tries not to attract
any attention, while it stops and thinks and works out the best
thing to do. (If antelopes had a technical support line, it would be
telephoning it at this point.) Then, once it has decided what the
safest thing to do is, it does it.

<p>
When something goes wrong, stop doing <em>anything</em>. Don't touch
any buttons at all. Look at the screen and notice everything out of
the ordinary, and remember it or write it down. <em>Then</em>
perhaps start cautiously pressing "OK" or "Cancel", whichever seems
safest. Try to make this reflexive: if a computer does anything
unexpected, your first reaction should be to freeze.

<p>
If you manage to get out of the problem, whether by closing down the
affected program or by rebooting the computer, a good thing to do is
to try to make it happen again. Programmers like problems that they
can reproduce more than once. Happy programmers fix bugs faster and
more efficiently.
</p>

<a name="symptoms"><h3>"I think the tachyon modulation must be
wrongly polarised."</h3></a>

<p>
It isn't only non-programmers who produce bad bug reports. Some of
the worst bug reports I've ever seen come from programmers, and even
from <em>good</em> programmers.

<p>
I worked with another programmer once, who kept finding bugs in his
own code and trying to fix them. Every so often he'd hit a bug he
couldn't solve, and he'd call me over to help. "What's gone wrong?"
I'd ask. He would reply by telling me his current opinion of what
had caused the problem.

<p>
This worked fine when his current opinion was right. It meant he'd
already done half the work and we were able to finish the job
together. It was efficient and useful.

<p>
But quite often he was <em>wrong</em>. We would work for some time
trying to figure out why some particular part of the program was
producing incorrect data, and eventually we would discover that it
wasn't, that we'd been investigating a perfectly good piece of code
for half an hour, and that the actual problem was somewhere else.

<p>
I'm sure he wouldn't do that to a doctor. "Doctor, I think I've got
Perkin's disease." People <em>know</em> not to say that to a doctor:
you describe the symptoms, the actual discomforts and aches and
pains and rashes and fevers, and you let the doctor make their own
diagnosis of what caused the problem. Otherwise the doctor dismisses
you as a hypochondriac or crackpot, and quite rightly so.

<p>
It's the same with programmers. Providing your own diagnosis might
be helpful sometimes, but <em>always</em> state the symptoms. The
diagnosis is an optional extra, and not an alternative to giving the
symptoms. Equally, sending a modification to the code which fixes
the problem is a useful addition to a bug report but not an adequate
substitute for one.

<p>
If a programmer asks you for extra information, don't make it up!
Somebody reported a bug to me once, and I asked him to try a command
which I <em>knew</em> would not work. The reason I asked him to try
it was that I wanted to know which of two different error messages
it would give. Knowing which error message came back was a vital
clue. But he didn't actually try it - he just mailed me back and
said "No, that won't work". It took me some time to persuade him to
try it for real.

<p>
Using your intelligence to help the programmer is fine. Even if your
deductions are wrong, the programmer should be grateful to you for
having at least <em>tried</em> to make their life easier. But report
the symptoms <em>as well</em>, or you run the risk of making their
life much more difficult.
</p>

<a name="intermittent"><h3>"That's funny, it did it a moment
ago."</h3></a>

<p>
Say "intermittent fault" to any programmer and watch their face fall.
The easy problems are the ones where you can follow a simple set of
instructions and cause the failure to occur. The programmer can then
repeat those instructions under closely observed test conditions and
watch what happens in great detail. Too many problems simply don't
work that way: there will be programs that fail once a week, or fail
once in a blue moon, or never fail when you try them in front of the
programmer but always fail when you have a deadline coming up.

<p>
Most intermittent faults are not truly intermittent. Most of them
have some logic somewhere. Some might fail when the machine is
running out of memory. Some might fail when another program tries to
modify a critical file at the wrong moment. Some might fail for the
first half of every hour! (I've actually seen one of these.)

<p>
Also, if you can reproduce the bug but the programmer can't, it
could very well be that their computer and your computer are
different in some way and that that difference is causing the
problem. I had a program once whose window curled up into a little
ball in the top left corner of the screen, and sat there and
<em>sulked</em>. But it only did it on 800x600 screens; it was fine
on my 1024x768 monitor.

<p>
The programmer will want to know anything you can find out about the
problem. Try it on another machine, perhaps. Try it twice or three
times and see how often it fails. If it goes wrong when you're doing
serious work but not when you're trying to demonstrate it, it might
be long running times or large files that make it fall over. Try to
remember as much detail as you can about what you were doing to it
when it <em>did</em> fall over, and if you see any patterns, mention
them. Anything you can provide has got to be some help. Even if it's
only probabilistic (such as "it tends to crash more often when Emacs
is running"), it might not provide direct clues to the cause of the
problem, but it might help the programmer reproduce it.

<p>
Mostly, the programmer will want to be sure of whether he's dealing
with a true intermittent fault or a machine-specific fault. They
will want to know lots of details about your computer, so they can
work out how it differs from theirs. A lot of these details will
depend on the particular program, but one thing you should
<em>definitely</em> be ready to provide is version numbers. The
version number of the program itself, and the version number of the
operating system, and probably the version numbers of any other
programs that are involved in the problem.
</p>

<a name="clarity"><h3>"So I loaded the disk on to my Windows . .
."</h3></a>

<p>
Writing clearly is essential in a bug report. If the programmer
can't tell what you meant, you might as well not have said anything.

<p>
I get bug reports from all around the world. Many of them are from
non-native English speakers, and a lot of those apologise for their
poor English. In general, the bug reports which apologise for their
poor English are actually very clear and useful. All the most
unclear reports come from <em>native</em> English speakers who
assume that I will understand them even if they don't make any
effort to be clear or precise.

<p>
<em>Be specific</em>. When you describe what you did, if you can do
the same thing two different ways, state which one you used. "I
selected Load" might mean "I clicked on Load" or "I pressed Alt-L".
Say which one you did. Sometimes it matters.

<p>
<em>Be verbose</em>. Give more information rather than less. If you
say too much, the programmer has to ignore some of it. If you say
too little, they have to come back and ask you more questions. One
bug report I received was a single sentence, and every time I asked
for more information the reporter would reply with another single
sentence. It took me several weeks to get a useful amount of
information, because it turned up one short sentence at a time.

<p>
<em>Be careful of pronouns</em>. Don't use words like "it", or
references like "the window", when it's unclear what they mean.
Consider this: "I started FooApp. It put up a warning window. I
tried to close it and it crashed." It isn't clear what the user
tried to close. Did they try to close the warning window, or the
whole of FooApp? It makes a difference. When it isn't clear,
<em>make</em> it clear by saying it in full. A bug report that says
"the FooApp main window" three times in every sentence is often more
useful than a bug report that says "it" most of the time, because
the longer version <em>cannot be misunderstood</em>.

<p>
<em>Read what you wrote</em>. Read the report back to yourself, and
see if <em>you</em> think it's clear. If you have listed a set of
instructions on how to produce the failure, try following those
instructions yourself, to see if you missed a step.
</p>

<a name="respect"><h3>"It doesn't work."</h3></a>

<p>
Give the programmer some credit for basic intelligence. If the
program really didn't work <em>at all</em>, they would probably have
noticed. Since they haven't noticed, it must be working for them.
Therefore, either you are doing something differently to them, or
your environment is different from theirs. They need information.

<p>
Many programs, particularly free ones, publish their list of known
bugs. If you can find a list of known bugs, it's worth reading it to
see if the bug you've just found is already known or not. If it's
already known, it <em>probably</em> isn't worth reporting again. If
you think you have more information than the report in the bug list,
though, you might want to contact the programmer anyway, because if
you can give them information they didn't already have, they might
be able to fix the bug more easily.

<p>
This essay is full of guidelines. None of them is an absolute rule.
Particular programmers have particular ways they like bugs to be
reported. If the program comes with its own set of bug reporting
guidelines, read those. If the guidelines that come with the program
contradict the guidelines in this essay, obey the ones that come
with the program!
</p>

<a name="summary"><h3>Summary</h3></a>

<p>
The first aim of a bug report is to let the programmer see the
failure with their own eyes. If you can't make it fail in front of
them, give them detailed instructions so that he can make it fail
for themselves.

<p>
If the first aim doesn't succeed: the second aim of a bug report is
to describe what went wrong, so that the programmer doesn't have to
see it failing themselves. Describe everything in detail. State what
you saw <em>and</em> what you expected to see. Write down the error
messages, <em>especially</em> if they have numbers in.

<p>
When your computer does something unexpected, <em>freeze</em>. Do
nothing until you're calm, and don't do anything that you think
might be dangerous.

<p>
By all means try to diagnose the fault yourself if you think you
can, but don't use that as an <em>alternative</em> to reporting the
symptoms.

<p>
Be ready to provide extra information if the programmer needs it. If
they didn't need it, they wouldn't be asking you for it. They aren't
being deliberately awkward. Have version numbers at your fingertips,
because they will probably be needed.

<p>
Write clearly. Say what you mean, and make sure it's impossible to
mistake what you mean.

<p>
Above all, <em>be precise</em>. Programmers like precision.
