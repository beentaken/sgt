<h2>mkwinfont</h2>

<p>
<code>mkwinfont</code> is a small program that generates Windows
bitmap fonts from a text description. Also supplied is
<code>dewinfont</code>, which generates the text description files
from the source fonts.

<p>
The programs are written in Python, so you will need the Python
interpreter to run them. The Python interpreter can be downloaded
from
<a href="http://www.python.org/">www.python.org</a>.

<p>
Windows .FON files come in two different types: NE and PE. These
stand for New Executable and Portable Executable (Windows font files
have the same basic structure as Windows executables). NE is the old
format that was used by Windows 3, and PE is the new 32-bit
executable format used in Win95 and above. I believe <em>fonts</em>
in PE format are not supported by anything below Windows NT. (So
oddly, the "new" NE is the older of the two formats, and the
"portable" PE is the one which doesn't work everywhere!) The
"mkwinfont" script below generates NE fonts only, so they should
work everywhere. The "dewinfont" script can untangle both NE and PE
fonts, so you could use these scripts to convert a non-portable PE
font into a portable NE one.

<p>
The files are provided for download here:

<h2>Tektite</h2>

Tektite is a 9x15-pixel bitmap font which I use for almost all my
text-based computing (terminal windows and text editors, on both
Unix and Windows). I originally constructed it from the font named
"t" in the Slackware "kbd" package; this font in turn, according to
a README in an old version of this package, was extracted from a DOS
utility called VFONT, apparently created by
<a href="http://www.clysmic.com/attic/">clySmic Software</a>.

<p>
I'm therefore uncertain of the copyright status of this font. The
original VFONT copyright said you could copy and distribute the
VFONT program itself without charge but couldn't sell it; however no
mention was made of derivative works. My Tektite font as distributed
here is a derivative work: I've redrawn a couple of the uglier
characters (notably the zero and the asterisk) and added a whole
load of additional characters to make the font ISO-8859-1
compatible. I've mailed clySmic twice to ask about this, but they
have never replied.

<p>
On the assumption that clySmic is either defunct or doesn't care
about what I'm doing, I'm therefore offering my ultimately
VFONT-derived fonts for download. If they ever contact me and
request that I stop doing so, I will.

<p>
So, here are the Tektite files for download:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="tektite.fon">tektite.fon</a>
is Tektite in the form of a Windows .FON bitmap font. Character
encoding is Windows-1252 (the usual superset of ISO-8859-1), but
also the bottom 32 glyphs contain the VT100 line-drawing character
set (which makes it suitable for use with the "Font has XWindows
encoding" option in
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>).
Also
<a href="tektite.fd">tektite.fd</a>,
a textual font description in the format accepted by the "mkwinfont"
script above.
<li>
<a href="tektitec.fon">tektitec.fon</a>
is Tektite in the form of a Windows .FON bitmap font, but under the
name "Terminal" so that DOS boxes are able to use it. Character
encoding is CP437 (the old DOS encoding, with some multinational
characters and a lot of line-drawing stuff). Also
<a href="tektitec.fd">tektitec.fd</a>,
a textual font description in the format accepted by the "mkwinfont"
script above.
<li>
<a href="tektite.pcf.gz">tektite.pcf.gz</a>
and
<a href="tektite.pcf.Z">tektite.pcf.Z</a>
(choose your preferred compression) are both Tektite in the form of
an X bitmap font. The font name is
"<code>-clySmic-Tektite-Medium-R-Normal--15-140-75-75-C-90-ISO8859-1</code>".
Character encoding is the X adaptation of ISO-8859-1 (i.e. the
bottom 32 glyphs contain the VT100 line-drawing characters). Also
<a href="tektite.bdf">tektite.bdf</a>,
the textual BDF form of the font (suitable for input to the X
utility "bdftopcf").
</ul>

<h2>fixed for Windows</h2>

<p>
Many X users swear by the font called "fixed" or "6x13". It's small
but readable, and it allows a lot of terminal windows on screen at
once.

<p>
Since I have scripts that can create Windows fonts from textual
descriptions, inevitably I was asked to produce a Windows version of
"fixed" for one of my friends. Here it is for download, in case
anyone else wants it:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="fixed.fon">fixed.fon</a> is "fixed" in the form of a
Windows .FON bitmap font. Character encoding is Windows-1252 (the
usual superset of ISO-8859-1), but also the bottom 32 glyphs contain
the VT100 line-drawing character set (which makes it suitable for
use with the "Font has XWindows encoding" option in
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>).
Also
<a href="fixed.fd">fixed.fd</a>,
a textual font description in the format accepted by the "mkwinfont"
script above.
<li>
<a href="fixedc.fon">fixedc.fon</a>
is "fixed" in the form of a Windows .FON bitmap font, but under the
name "Terminal" so that DOS boxes are able to use it. Character
encoding is CP437 (the old DOS encoding, with some multinational
characters and a lot of line-drawing stuff). Also
<a href="fixedc.fd">fixedc.fd</a>,
a textual font description in the format accepted by the "mkwinfont"
script above.
</ul>
