Things to remember when adding a new puzzle
-------------------------------------------

Write the source file for the new puzzle (duhh).

Add it to Recipe in _four_ places:
 - the `ALL' definition, to ensure it is compiled into the OS X binary
 - as a GTK build target
 - as a Windows build target
 - in the Unix `make install' section at the bottom.

Add it to list.c so that the OS X binary will be able to select it
from the menus. (Also, double-check that the game structure name in
the source file has been renamed from `nullgame'. Actually compiling
it on OS X would be a good way to check this, if convenient.)

Add a documentation section in puzzles.but.

Make sure there's a Windows help topic name defined in puzzles.but,
and that it's referenced by the help topic field in the game
structure in the source file.

Add the new Unix binary name to the svn:ignore property.

Don't forget to `svn add' the new source file before checkin!

Put the puzzle on the web:
 - make a screenshot
 - add an entry in the puzzles list in index.html
 - add a link to the Windows binary
 - make sure the Windows binary link points at the right binary, not
   the wrong one!
 - run puzzlesnap
 - test that the binary link and the docs link work
 - run webupdate
 - test again
 - `svn add' the binary symlink and the screenshot
 - check in the website changes (screenshot, symlink, index.html)
