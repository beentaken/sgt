Q: What exactly does "suspend" do in an edithook function?

A:
  It suspends the thread that's running the edithook. This has the effect of
  terminating the function call, so that the top N items on the stack are then
  used as the return values from the function. But the next time the function is
  called, instead of starting from the top of the function, execution will resume
  just after the suspend call (with the top N items having been removed).
  
  The idea is that many editing procedures are best done in this way - if you
  want to specify a sequence of actions which the interface requires you to
  return one by one, you suspend with each one, and thus successive calls to the
  edit hook return the sequence.
  
  It's a property of the fact that the edithook runs in its own thread -
  `suspend' affects the Loew thread rather than the function itself - so don't
  expect to be able to use it in user functions and get coroutine mechanics.
