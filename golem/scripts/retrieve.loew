# Loew script to read some files, if they've been updated since last being
# read.

# Notes on loew:

# all whitespace (including newlines) is equivalent.
# Text after a # is ignored until the end of the line. (Assuming the # isn't
# somehow inside a token.)

# Strings are either quoted with leading and trailing "s, in which case
# sequences such as \n are interpreted as you'd expect, or quoted with an
# initial ' and finish at the next piece of whitespace.

# Full list of character sequences recognised in ""s: \n \r \e
# \x followed by up to 2 hex digits
# \ followed by up to 3 octal digits

# Loew is stack based - so for example the arguments to a function appear
# before the name of the function in the code.

# declare variables - all variables are global
var cffh
var parts
var monopath
var filepath
var fh

var dataroot # Root that data gets stored beneath.
             # Must contains two directories - files for files, and messages
	     # for messages.
	     # Should also contain a files.cf file, to say what files to get.

	     # May also contain a .<username>.passwd file, which should
	     # contain (solely) the password of the user specified to log in
	     # as (in the username function.)
	     # Warning: if this is done, passwords may
	     # appear in the diagnostics log, which should therefore probably
	     # be a symlink to /dev/null, and the unix permissions on the
	     # file should (obviously) be carefully checked.  I wouldn't
	     # recommend doing this with an "important", eg staff, account.
	     # Your call, of course.

	     # If the password is wrong, or the file is not there, it will be
	     # prompted for on the stdin (and not displayed as it is typed,
	     # if this is a terminal.)

  # Step by step explanation of this:
  # 'Messages pushes the string Messages onto the stack
  # dataroot pushes the contents of variable dataroot onto the stack
  # "messages/allmessages.new." pushes that onto the stack
  # . concatenates the two strings on the top of the stack
  # username . similarly puts the contents of variable username onto the end
  # of the item on the top of the stack
  # 'Filename pushes Filename onto the stack
  # addtask adds a task to the queue of things to be done.  This task has the
  # parameter Filename (top of the stack) which has value <next item on stack>
  # The type of the task is Messages - read our messages into the file
  # specified in the parameter Filename.
