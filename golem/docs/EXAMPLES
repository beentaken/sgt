Good example, with comments, is scripts/retrieve.loew, with
scripts/retrieve.pl which calls it.

Other examples exist in commands/, but are more experimental and uncommented.

The standard one I usually put in from the command line (`golem -') looks
vaguely like

  'Read "MLYD" 'Keypath "my-diary.dump" 'Filename addtask

For a slightly bigger one which does something useful (it's already been run,
with the parameters as shown, so don't run it again 'cos that would be silly):

  var keypath
  "MLNSCRUPLE!" =keypath
  
  'Setname "      _                           " 'Nameline addtask             
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask                                             
  'Setname "__/\\_| |__  _   _  __ _ ___ __/\\__" 'Nameline addtask           
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask                                             
  'Setname "\\    / '_ \\| | | |/ _` / __|\\    /" 'Nameline addtask          
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask                                             
  'Setname "/_  _\\ | | | |_| | (_| \\__ \\/_  _\\" 'Nameline addtask         
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask                                             
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask
  'Setname "  \\/ |_| |_|\\__,_|\\__, |___/  \\/  " 'Nameline addtask
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask                                             
  'Setname "                  |___/           " 'Nameline addtask
  'Visit keypath 'Keypath addtask
  'Setname "golem: learning conformity" 'Nameline addtask

And for something which defines a function (thus demonstrating the use of edit
hooks):

  var line var lines var text
  
  'anakin =username
  
  'Edit "MLYD" 'Keypath 'eh 'Edithook addtask
  
  function eh {
    =line =lines =text
    lines 'Goto suspend =line =lines =text
    loop
      line 1 - ! if-break
      'Up suspend =line =lines =text
    endloop
    'Quit                                                                     
  }

(that one just loads my diary into the raw editor and runs through it from
bottom to top. In theory, by extracting the relevant lines from `diagnostics'
and using `tac' to reverse them, I should get my diary back in pure raw form.
Sadly it misses a line due to the bug.)
