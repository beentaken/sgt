#!/usr/bin/perl

# Script for automatically launching URLs.
#
#  - Will read data from the command line (if a URL argument is
#    supplied) or from the X selection via `xcopy -r' (if not).
#  - Will process that data into a plausible URL, by means of
#    stripping newlines and whitespace, prepending `http://' if it
#    looks like a good idea, or prepending `file://' if the data
#    begins with a single leading slash.
#  - If passed `-g', it will instead use the data to construct a
#    Google search URL.
#  - Will then launch the URL.
#
# Configuration files:
#
#  - `~/.urllaunch' is an optional piece of Perl which configures
#    the browser to use. It should define two variables, $try1 and
#    $try2. Each of them should be a piece of Perl which evaluates
#    to a list of strings suitable for passing to `exec' or
#    `system'. See the default definitions below for an example.
#
#  - `~/.urlrewrite' is an optional executable script. Once the
#    final URL has been constructed, it is piped through this
#    script if it exists. The script may produce no output if it
#    does not wish to rewrite the URL, or else it may output a
#    different URL (which must be fully formed).

# if there isn't a running Mozilla, so we must be alert for a
# failure return and launch `mozilla $url' if we see one.
