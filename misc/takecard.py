# 1000 cards numbered 1 to 1000 are shuffled.
# One card at a time is dealt.
# You can take or leave each card as it is dealt.
# After you have taken your first card, you can only take a card if it is
# higher than the last one you took.
# The aim is to take as many as you can.
# 
# You are free to note dealt cards, use computers, charts, tables or
# chicken entrails to decide on action for each card as it comes.
# 
# How many could you expect to take?
