Caltrap wish list
-----------------

Immediate things that need doing:

 - Invent a better notation for time intervals (3d4h5m springs to
   mind) and use it in cron.c.

 - Sort out how timeless all-day events fit into cron. And how they
   fit into list - I suspect I broke them when I adapted
   db_list_entries.

Longer-term things I'd like:

 - TODO tracking
    + TODOs have a start date (they will need doing after that time,
      but aren't required yet)
    + And some have an end date (i.e. a deadline)
       * perhaps listing TODOs in order of _urgency_, i.e. closeness
	 of deadline, might be an interesting experiment.

 - Multiple-day events such as holidays.

 - Regular events (so that pub, pizza, Calling show up on my leisure
   calendar).
    + These need to be easily cancelled, rearranged etc when
      exceptions are made.
       * In particular, I wonder what would happen if the Calling
	 suddenly switched to the _other_ coset of Tuesdays? I think
	 ideally the past should remain unchanged, and the future
	 should shift. Which probably means regular events should
	 have a start and an end date, or some such.

 - Coloured output via terminfo?
    + background colour highlights weekends?
    + something to highlight holidays?
    + simply colouring dates, times and entry text differently would
      do wonders for immediate legibility.

 - Improve the database schema.
    + Changes and additional fields will be required to work with
      some of the above features.
    + Also some form of ID number per entry would be very useful, so
      that entries can be conveniently deleted and modified.
       * this doesn't want to be shown in the usual calendar
	 displays; probably a `-v' flag makes it appear.
