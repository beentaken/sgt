Things left to do on this build system
--------------------------------------

 - Finish the manual.

 - A man page, just for completeness. It won't say anything that
   isn't said better by the main manual, but it might come in handy
   for those occasions where --help doesn't tell you quite what you
   wanted but going to the full manual is overkill...

Wishlist features for possible future work
------------------------------------------

 - Revisit the code that guesses whether a command-line argument is
   a real working directory or an SVN module name. There might be a
   better heuristic, and there should almost certainly be command-
   line options to override the heuristic if we know better.

 - It would be nice to be able to build from a local directory that
   _isn't_ an svn checkout. This would involve $(revision) not being
   set, and the build script would have to cope with that.

 - It would also be nice to lose the total Subversion-centredness.
   It's not clear whether we can manage total generality across
   version control systems, but at least _some_ generality might be
   nice.
