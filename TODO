Things left to do on this build system
--------------------------------------

 - Documentation.
    + man page
    + actual manual
    + bumf.py (usage and licence messages) is unwritten

 - Revisit the code that guesses whether a command-line argument is
   a real working directory or an SVN module name. There might be a
   better heuristic, and there should almost certainly be command-
   line options to override the heuristic if we know better.
