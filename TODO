Caltrap wish list
-----------------

 - Ability to edit and remove entries given their id.
    + for starters we need a modified listing mode which _shows_ the
      ids, then! Perhaps `-l -v', or `-L'.
       * may also need to explicitly show behind-the-scenes entries
	 such as textless things (weekends spring to mind).
    + this ability is a necessary prerequisite for TODO tracking,
      because otherwise there's no way to mark a TODO as done once
      you've done it.

 - Concoct a script to set up UK public holidays for a given year.
   This should be separate from Caltrap proper; probably a shell
   script would be fine.

 - Multiple-day events.
    + should these show up as multiple-day in the listing if they're
      type EVENT? Unclear. Depends on what I'm going to use them
      for!

 - TODO tracking
    + we have type TODO in the db schema; start using it.
    + TODOs have a start date
    + And some have an end date (i.e. a deadline)
       * perhaps listing TODOs in order of _urgency_, i.e. closeness
	 of deadline, might be an interesting experiment.
    + NB some TODOs have no start date. We might need some sort of
      special date meaning `since the dawn of time'. Hmmm.
       * this would also be useful for e.g. weekends.

 - Birthdays, perhaps?
    + unclear how this is not exactly equivalent to an EVENT.
    + perhaps birthdays are not shown on the default calendar
      display?
       * in that case, perhaps a more generic `hidden' category
	 might be more appropriate?
    + perhaps birthday reminders come in two forms, one a few weeks
      in advance to arrange a card, and the other nearer the time to
      get it posted?
       * more generally, a means of configuring the reminder profile
	 for particular types of event would be helpful.
    + Perhaps, then, the right thing is to create a fresh db table
      which defines event types.
       * Can configure under what circumstances they show up on the
	 calendar listing.
       * Can configure the reminder profile in some fashion.
       * If we can also configure their colouring, then perhaps we
	 could even fold all the existing event types into this!
    + Actually, come to think of it, if you enter a _date_ of birth
      into the calendar, it can remind you of how old the person is
      when their birthday rolls round. (Though of course not all
      birthdays would be suitable for this! :-)
    + Arrgh! And owing to leap years, a birthday isn't a
      conventional repeating event at all, since it occurs on the
      same day every year irrespective of whether there were 365 or
      366 days in between. OK, I think we do need a special event
      type for this sort of thing.
