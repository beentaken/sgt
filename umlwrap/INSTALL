This directory contains "umlwrap", a User-Mode Linux based process
isolation utility.

The umlwrap program consists of two parts:

 - umlwrap itself, which should go on your normal PATH

 - a small directory tree which is mounted as the root filesystem by
   umlwrap's invocation of UML, including in particular a custom
   "init" program which runs inside the UML and knows how to talk to
   the outer half of umlwrap running outside it.

Hence, you cannot just type "make" in this directory and expect to
get a binary you can run: if you haven't run "make install", it will
fail to find its root file system. So you must have run "make
install" before anything useful will happen.

Furthermore, the outer umlwrap program requires the pathname of the
root directory tree hard-coded into it, so when you first run "make"
you have to have already decided where you're going to install it.

For example, if you start with a clean source directory and run

  make install prefix=$HOME

then you will get umlwrap installed in $HOME/bin, the root file
system including umlwrap's init installed in $HOME/lib/umlwrap, and
the man page in $HOME/man/man1. Those subdirectories can be
individually overridden if you need them to be: look in Makefile to
find the names of the variables to define on the make command line.

If you expect to be running "make install" repeatedly (e.g. you're
doing umlwrap development), you can relieve the monotony of
specifying your preferred prefix setting the whole time by creating
a small file called "Makefile.local" and adding a line defining your
preferred prefix, e.g.

  prefix = /home/simon

Then just "make install" will do the right thing.
