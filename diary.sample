{t Sample Half-Title}: Things On Springs

This is a simple paragraph full of text. It should be wrapped
correctly on mono, and should appear without line breaks in HTML. It
goes on for a while, so it should be possible to work out whether
this was in fact the case, which always helps. In it we have {q
quoted text}, and {e emphasis}, and {b boldness}. All of these
things should be rendered appropriately in both formats. Oh, and
there's a footnote{1} as well.

Special characters: {L}12.99.

{talker}
{tl}Users in faff: none
{tb}
{tl golem}{q Hello.}
{tl anakin}{q Ooh, hi there.}
{tl longline}{q This is a talker-formatted paragraph. Ain't that
cool? Now let's see if this line will wrap.}
{tl {name simont anakin} }wonders whether {{name}} in {{tl}} will work

{ljcut LJ cut}

Here's a paragraph enclosed in an LJ cut tag. While I'm in here I'll
just mention that I can type braces if I really need to: {{ and }}.
So there.

{/ljcut}

Here is {name simont Simon}'s name, which should come out as a magic
LJ user tag on LJ but be normal text on Mono.

{Q}
This paragraph is quoted. This means that on mono, it should be
yellow and have angle bracket characters to its left. Other than
that, it should wrap in the same way as usual. In HTML, it should
show up as a blockquote element with a style giving it a left
margin bar, so it's obviously a quotation.
{/Q}

{q}
This paragraph is weakly quoted; on Mono it's yellow but has no
angle brackets, and in HTML it will be a blockquote element but not
have the left-bar style.
{/q}

{pre}
Here's some preformatted text.
Line breaks are honoured in here, and spaces  are    significant.
We can still do {e emphasis} and so forth.

{mbreak (continued)}

{Q}
{pre}
This is    preformatted
{e and} quoted
and so it's kinda fun.

{/Q}

This paragraph isn't preformatted{br}
but it does have line breaks{br}
inserted explicitly.{br}
Note that the one at the end is optional but harmless.{br}

Nearly there now. I need to mention bulletted lists:

{b} Bullet point.

{b} Bullet point again. This one has a bunch of text in it, to check
that wrapping and all that sort of thing works correctly in
bulletted paragraphs. I shall be annoyed if it wraps three spaces
further over than the unbulletted text does!

Also I need to be able to quote URLs. Here's one inline (though
it'll be displayed on Mono). Note how the following period shows up
in the HTML, but not after the display on Mono: {url
http://www.tartarus.org/foo-bar.html . }There, that wasn't hard was
it?

{b} This URL is quoted in a bulletted paragraph, to check that that
sort of paragraph is resumed correctly. {url
http://www.tartarus.org/foo-bar.html . }And here's the continuation.

Here are some inline URLs. Note also that HTTP prefixes and trailing
slashes are added where obviously necessary: {url
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham}, {url
www.arachsys.com/~jls}, {url www.tartarus.org}.

{1} Here's the text of the footnote.
