Caltrap wish list
-----------------

 - TODO tracking
    + we have type TODO in the db schema; start using it.
    + TODOs have a start date
    + And some have an end date (i.e. a deadline)
       * perhaps listing TODOs in order of _urgency_, i.e. closeness
	 of deadline, might be an interesting experiment.
    + NB some TODOs have no start date. We might need some sort of
      special date meaning `since the dawn of time'. Hmmm.

 - Multiple-day events.
    + should these show up somehow in the listing if they're type
      EVENT? Unclear. Depends on what I'm going to use them for!

 - Use of the holiday types.
    + these should highlight throughout their run.

 - Regular events (so that pub, pizza, Calling show up on my leisure
   calendar).
    + the db schema now supports these and we can hack them in using
      --load, but we can't enter them.

 - Concoct a script to set up UK public holidays for a given year.
   This should be separate from Caltrap proper; probably a shell
   script would be fine.

 - Coloured output via terminfo?
    + background colour highlights weekends?
    + something to highlight holidays?
    + simply colouring dates, times and entry text differently would
      do wonders for immediate legibility.
