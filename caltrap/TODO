Caltrap wish list
-----------------

Urgent:

 - TERMINAL QUERYING!
    + Stop assuming ECMA-48; figure out some plausibly sane way to
      get terminfo to tell us the colour escape sequences we need.
    + And also stop assuming an 80-character line. GNU ls's
      behaviour seems plausible enough: use termios if possible,
      fall back to getenv("COLOURS") if not, fall back to 80 if not
      even that.

Less urgent:

 - Ability to enter holiday entries other than by db frobbing.

 - Ability to enter repeated events other than by db frobbing.

 - Concoct a script to set up UK public holidays for a given year.
   This should be separate from Caltrap proper; probably a shell
   script would be fine.

 - Multiple-day events.
    + should these show up as multiple-day in the listing if they're
      type EVENT? Unclear. Depends on what I'm going to use them
      for!

 - TODO tracking
    + we have type TODO in the db schema; start using it.
    + TODOs have a start date
    + And some have an end date (i.e. a deadline)
       * perhaps listing TODOs in order of _urgency_, i.e. closeness
	 of deadline, might be an interesting experiment.
    + NB some TODOs have no start date. We might need some sort of
      special date meaning `since the dawn of time'. Hmmm.
