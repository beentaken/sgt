# Spigot algorithm to produce the digits of pi and e, without
# having to commit in advance to the number of digits desired (so
# you can just keep going until memory or CPU time runs out).
# Implemented from the description given in
#
# http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/jeremy.gibbons/publications/spigot.pdf
#
# and enhanced (for e, different bases and continued fractions) by
# me.

# Usage:
#   spigot.py pi                 # generates pi in base 10
#   spigot.py -b7 pi             # generates pi in another base, e.g. 7
#   spigot.py -c pi              # generates continued fraction for pi
#   spigot.py e                  # generates e
#   spigot.py phi                # generates phi
#   spigot.py root 3             # generates the square root of 3
#
# You can also feed a stream of input to the program and it will
# convert between continued fraction terms and an arbitrary number base, or between number bases:
#   spigot.py cfrac              # reads continued fraction terms from stdin
#   spigot.py base 9             # reads a base-9 number from stdin

# Method (hopefully a slightly more accessible description than the
# one in the paper cited above):
#
# Pi can be represented as the sum of a series that goes
#   2 + (1/3 * 2) + (1/3 * 2/5 * 2) + (1/3 * 2/5 * 3/7 * 2) + ...
# = 2 + 1/3 * (2 + 2/5 * (2 + 3/7 * (2 + 4/9 * (...))))
#
# Another way of writing this is as an infinite composition of
# _functions_:
#
#   (x |-> 2+x/3) o (x |-> 2+2x/5) o (x |-> 2+3x/7) o ...
#
# This infinite composition converges, in the sense that if you
# take all of its `partial sums' (obtained by cutting it off after
# n terms) and examine the effect of each of those on the interval
# [3,4], you find that they map that interval to a sequence of
# nested subintervals which converge to the single point pi.
#
# So if we could efficiently generate those `partial sums' one
# after another, we could examine their effect on the interval
# [3,4] and whenever the images under a `partial sum' of the two
# ends of that interval agreed to the first n decimal places, then
# we would know we had found the first n digits of pi.
#
# These functions are all Mobius transformations, i.e. functions of
# the form x |-> (px+q)/(rx+s). These have the property that we can
# represent them as 2x2 matrices, and compose them by matrix
# multiplication. So the functions become a sequence of 2x2 integer
# matrices:
#
#   ( 1 6 )  ( 2 10 )  ( 3 14 ) ... ( k 4k+2 ) ...
#   ( 0 3 )  ( 0  5 )  ( 0  7 )     ( 0 2k+1 )
#
# Thus, we can compute successive partial products of this sequence
# of matrices simply by starting with the identity matrix and
# repeatedly post-multiplying by the next matrix in the sequence,
# and that gives us our `partial sums' of the infinite function
# composition.
#
# We can also extract digits from the left of this as they are
# generated. Suppose we currently have a function f(x) which has
# the property that f(3) and f(4) have the same integer part i.
# Then i is the first digit of pi. So we could continue to shovel
# further matrices into the right of f and wait until f(3) and f(4)
# agree in the first decimal place as well as the integer part; but
# a better approach which requires no fractional arithmetic is, at
# this point, to stop looking at f and start looking at (f-i)*10,
# so that the next digit of pi will appear when (f(3)-i)*10 and
# (f(4)-i)*10 agree in the integer part.
#
# The function we left-composed with f there is x |-> 10*x-i, which
# is _also_ a Mobius transformation; so we can apply it once to our
# gradually evolving matrix that represents f, this time by _pre_-
# multiplying it into that matrix, and forget about it thereafter.
#
# Hence, our finished algorithm goes like this:
#
#   Maintain a 2x2 integer matrix (p, q, r, s), which starts out as
#   (1, 0, 0, 1).
#
#   For ever:
#       If the integer parts of (3p+q)/(3r+s) and (4p+q)/(4r+s) are equal, then 
#       they are both equal to the next digit of pi.
#           So output that digit d, and pre-multiply our matrix by
#           (10,-10*d,0,1).
#       Otherwise, we don't currently have enough precision to know the
#       next digit of pi.
#           So find the next matrix in the sequence given above, and
#           post-multiply that into the matrix we're maintaining.
#
# It's that simple!
#
# To adapt the algorithm to e, we use the obvious series for e
# obtained by expanding the Taylor series for exp(1):
#
#  e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ...
#    = 1 + 1/1 * (1 + 1/2 * (1 + 1/3 * (1 + 1/4 * *...)))
#
# which gives us the infinite function composition
#
#   (x |-> 1+x) o (x |-> 1+x/2) o (x |-> 1+x/3) o ...
#
# and hence the sequence of matrices
#
#   ( 1 1 ) ( 1 2 ) ( 1 3 ) ... ( 1 k ) ...
#   ( 0 1 ) ( 0 2 ) ( 0 3 )     ( 0 k )
#
# We must also adjust the limits 3 and 4. We picked the interval
# [3,4] for the pi expansion because we know that each of the
# functions in the infinite composition for pi maps [3,4] to a
# subinterval of itself, meaning that the images of the ends of
# that interval always bracket pi. However, this is not true for
# the above series of functions for e. In fact, there is _no_
# interval which all of the above functions map to a subinterval of
# itself, because the first function (x |-> 1+x) translates every
# interval upwards!
#
# Fortunately, all the functions _other_ than the first one have
# the property that they map [0,2] to a subinterval of itself. So
# once the image of [0,2] under a `partial sum' of at least two
# terms of this function series contains e, its image under
# subsequent partial sums will be a subinterval of that and hence
# will always contain e as well. So we need only check that no
# spurious `digits' are output before that happens, and then we're
# safe. And this is OK, because the identity matrix maps [0,2] to
# [0,2] which doesn't have a constant integer part, the first
# function maps it to [1,3] which doesn't either, and the first two
# functions map it to [2,3] which contains e and is late enough in
# the series to be safe.
#
# At the output end, we can obviously modify the algorithm to yield
# digits in any base we like instead of ten. Mathematically, our
# means of generating digits involves repeatedly subtracting off
# the integer part and then multiplying by ten; so, clearly, if we
# subtract off the integer part and then multiply by some other
# number, we'll get the digits of pi or e in that base instead. (Of
# course, the _first_ digit extracted will be the original integer
# part of the number, which won't be within the right range if the
# target base is 2 or 3. But that's easy to correct for, and all
# subsequent digits will be in range.)
#
# Another neat trick is that this algorithm can be trivially
# switched to generate the terms of the continued fraction for pi
# (or e, although e's continued fraction is boringly regular). A
# theoretical algorithm for finding the terms of the continued
# fraction for a number, given exact real arithmetic, is to
# subtract off the integer part, take the reciprocal of the result,
# and repeat. And just like `subtract n and multiply by ten', the
# operation `subtract n and take the reciprocal' can also be
# written as a Mobius transformation - so by simply premultiplying
# by a different matrix every time we output a `digit', we can
# generate the continued fraction for pi to arbitrary length using
# exactly the same core algorithm.
#
# (Doing this does mean we have to watch out for division by zero
# when computing the candidate digit (3p+q)/(3r+s), for all values
# of 3. Division by zero indicates that the image of our starting
# interval under our current function is an interval with one end
# at infinity, so when this occurs we simply decide that a digit
# cannot safely be extracted at this time, and keep going. The
# interval will shrink to finite size as soon as another matrix is
# folded in.)

    # cheerfully return the same sequence of matrices over and over
    # again.
    #
    # The algorithm, taken from Wikipedia
    # (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots
    # as of 2007-04-28), is as follows:
    #
    #  - Let m <- 0, d <- 1, and a <- floor(sqrt(n)).
    #  - Repeatedly:
    #     + output a as a continued fraction term.
    #     + let m <- d*a-m.
    # 	  + let d <- (n-m^2)/d. (This division always yields an
    # 	    exact integer; see below.)
    # 	  + let a <- floor((sqrt(n)-m)/d). (We can safely replace
    # 	    sqrt(n) with floor(sqrt(n)) here without affecting the
    # 	    result.)
    # 	  + check if (m,d,a) repeats a set of values which it
    # 	    previously had at this point. If so, we need not
    # 	    continue calculating.
    #
    # Proof by induction that every value of d is an integer:
    #  - Base case: d_0 is an integer, because it's defined to be
    # 	 1.
    #  - Suppose d_i and all previous d_j are integers.
    # 	  + d_i was computed as (n-m_i^2)/d_{i-1}, and hence if
    # 	    it's an integer then d_{i-1} is a factor of (n-m_i^2),
    # 	    and so d_i is _also_ a factor of that.
    # 	  + Now m_{i+1} = d_i a_i - m_i. So n - m_{i+1}^2 is equal
    # 	    to n - (m_i - d_i a_i)^2 = n - m_i^2 + 2 d_i a_i m_i - d_i^2 a_i^2.
    # 	  + And d_i divides n - m_i^2 (by construction), and
    # 	    divides any multiple of d_i (obviously), so it divides
    # 	    that. Hence d_{i+1} will be an integer too. []
