This archive contains Enigma, a puzzle game.

This Enigma implementation was written by me, Simon Tatham. I can't
claim credit for inventing the game itself; the game rules and the
twelve original levels were devised by a friend, who wishes to
remain anonymous. He has waived copyright on his levels, and granted
them to the public domain.

Enigma is licensed under the MIT licence. See the file LICENCE for
details.

Designs for further levels are welcomed; please send them to
