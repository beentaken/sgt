<p>
PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Windows and Unix
platforms, along with an <code>xterm</code> terminal emulator. It is
written and maintained primarily by
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~anakin/">Simon Tatham</a>.

<p>
The latest version is beta 0.60.

<p><b>LEGAL WARNING</b>:
Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where
encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP,
PSFTP and Plink in England and Wales and in many other countries, but I am not a
lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before
downloading it. You may find
<a href="http://rechten.uvt.nl/koops/cryptolaw/">this site</a>
useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I
can't vouch for its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any
cryptography laws.

<h2>Latest news</h2>

<p>
<b>2007-04-29 PuTTY 0.60 is released</b>

<p>
PuTTY 0.60 is out, containing mostly bug fixes.

<p>
<b>2007-01-24 PuTTY 0.59 is released</b>

<p>
PuTTY 0.59 is out (finally!), and as previously announced we no
longer provide Alpha binaries.

<p>
<b>2006-03-31 Proposed withdrawal of Alpha NT PuTTY</b>

<p>
From the next release, we propose to stop providing binaries for
PuTTY on Windows NT on the Alpha processor.  Our own original need for
PuTTY on Alpha NT has gone, and our logs suggest that nobody else now
uses it.  If this is a problem for you, let us know.
