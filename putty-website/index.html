<p>
PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32
platforms, along with an <code>xterm</code> terminal emulator. It is
written and maintained primarily by
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~anakin/">Simon Tatham</a>.

<p>
The latest version is beta 0.53b.

<p><b>LEGAL WARNING</b>:
Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where
encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP,
PSFTP and Plink in England and many other countries, but I am not a
lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before
downloading it. You may find
<a href="http://rechten.kub.nl/koops/cryptolaw/index.htm">this site</a>
useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I
can't vouch for its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any
cryptography laws.
