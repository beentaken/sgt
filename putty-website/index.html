<p>
PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Windows and Unix
platforms, along with an <code>xterm</code> terminal emulator. It is
written and maintained primarily by
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~anakin/">Simon Tatham</a>.

<p>
The latest version is beta 0.62.

<p><b>LEGAL WARNING</b>:
Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where
encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP,
PSFTP and Plink in England and Wales and in many other countries, but I am not a
lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before
downloading it. You may find
<a href="http://rechten.uvt.nl/koops/cryptolaw/">this site</a>
useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I
can't vouch for its correctness.
</p>

<p>
Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any
cryptography laws.

<h2>Latest news</h2>

<p>
<b>2011-12-10 PuTTY 0.62 released</b>

<p>
PuTTY 0.62 is out, containing only bug fixes from 0.61, in particular a
<a href="wishlist/password-not-wiped.html">security fix</a>
preventing passwords from being accidentally retained in memory.

<p>
<b>2011-11-27 PuTTY 0.62 pre-release builds available</b>

<p>
PuTTY 0.61 had a few noticeable bugs in it (but nothing
security-related), so we are planning to make a 0.62 release
containing just bug fixes. The Wishlist page lists the bugs that will
be fixed by the 0.62 release. The Download page now contains
pre-release snapshots of 0.62, which contain those bug fixes and
should be otherwise stable. (The usual development snapshots,
containing other development since 0.61, are also still available.)

<p>
<b>2011-07-12 PuTTY 0.61 is released</b>

<p>
PuTTY 0.61 is out, after over four years (sorry!), with new features,
bug fixes, and compatibility updates for Windows 7 and various SSH
server software.

<p>
<b>2010-05-17 Google listing confusion</b>

<p>
Several users have pointed out to us recently that the top Google
hit for "putty" is now not the official PuTTY site but a mirror that
used to be listed on our Mirrors page.
<p>
The official PuTTY web page is still where it has always been:
