Release FIXME
-------------

 - We no longer repeat the game-completed screen when the user
   recompletes a level after having completed the game.

Release 1.01
------------

 - configure script now chooses more sensibly between curses and
   ncurses, and also checks whether *curses.h defines attr_t. Now
   able to compile on Solaris/gcc.
 - Renamed config.h to settings.h to stop it being blown away by
   make distclean.
 - Added CHANGELOG.

Release 1.0
-----------

 - Initial release.
