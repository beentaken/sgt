LJ interests list, categorised for easy thinking
------------------------------------------------

In this multi-level bulletted outline I'm going to adopt the
convention that any line bulletted with a + sign is an actual
interest, and - and * are used for comments. So it should be easy
enough to convert this file into the real interests text, by running
it through Perl on itself (`perl interests interests').

       * (wonderful phrase dreamed up by &feanelwa)
    + depends why you're asking
       * (I often think this is the right answer to difficult
	 borderline questions of semantics or philosophy, such as
	 'does a virus count as alive?' or 'are these two people
	 actually going out or not?' or 'do we have free will?'.
	 I've found myself saying it so often that I think I should
	 start drawing attention to it in a more general way.)
