LJ interests list, categorised for easy thinking
------------------------------------------------

In this multi-level bulletted outline I'm going to adopt the
convention that any line bulletted with a + sign is an actual
interest, and - and * are used for comments. So it should be easy
enough to convert this file into the real interests text, by running
it through Perl on itself (`perl interests interests').
