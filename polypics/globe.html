<p>
To create my polyhedral globes, I started off with the
<a href="http://edc.usgs.gov/products/elevation/gtopo30/gtopo30.html">GTOPO30</a>
data set from the 
<a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">US Geological Survey</a>.

<p>
GTOPO30 is conceptually an enormous rectangle of raw bitmap data.
Its <i>x</i>-coordinate runs from longitude 180&#176;W to 180&#176;E
in steps of 1/120 degree, and its <i>y</i>-coordinate runs from
latitude 90&#176;N to 90&#176;S in the same increments. So the
entire bitmap is 43200&#215;21600. It has 16 bits per pixel, which
are a single 16-bit integer giving the ground elevation in metres
above sea level for that position on the globe. The special value
-9999 indicates sea. (So the data set distinguishes between sea and
ground that's below sea level: negative values other than -9999
exist, for example in the Caspian Sea.) Instead of a single 1.7Gb
data file, the data is divided into 33 smaller rectangular tiles.

<p>
Converting that source data into a spherical image was basically a
long job of step-by-step transformation.

<p>
I began with a black-and-white globe, which simply distinguished sea
from land. So my first job here was to convert the 16bpp bitmap
described above into a 1bpp bitmap, in which each pixel either
denoted "land" or "sea". This is a simple matter of streaming data
processing.

<p>
My method of defining spherical images is basically vector-based, so
the next step was to convert that bitmap into a set of vector data
which drew round each coastline. For this, I used an existing
tracing program,
<a href="http://potrace.sourceforge.net/"><code>potrace</code></a>.

<p>
Since I wanted to end up with relatively small chunks, this was also
a good moment to divide the large bitmap into sufficiently small
pieces and trace them all separately &#8211; not forgetting to
ensure a small amount of overlap between the pieces, to avoid
potential rounding error if two regions of blackness exactly shared
a boundary. (There's always the risk that PostScript's floating
point processing might happen to round the boundaries in opposite
directions, so you might end up with white pixels at the joining
line. Ensuring a small overlap solves this.)

<p>
Also during the tracing phase, I had to select my resolution. My
globes were not actually generated from the full-resolution GTOPO30
bitmap; that would have made all the coastlines much more complex,
and hence bloated the size of the output PDFs, for little or no
visible benefit. So I had to choose a factor by which to shrink the
bitmaps before tracing, so as to best trade off file size against
detail. I ended up shrinking them by a factor of 10.

<p>
After that, I had to take all my pieces of plane vector data,
convert them back into spherical coordinates, and restore them to
their correct places on the globe. Having done that, I had a
spherical image describing my black and white globe!

<p>
For the colour version, I simply repeated the entire procedure
several times, with the only difference being that the initial
reduction from 16bpp to 1bpp was done by setting a different
elevation threshold for each layer. Thus, I ended up with a set of
dark green polygons describing land, then a set of lighter green
polygons describing all land higher than 200m, lighter still for
land higher than 400m, and so on. Then I overlaid all those polygons
(in the right order, of course), and there was my coloured globe. No
additional conceptual difficulty, just a matter of running the same
program several times with a different argument.

Here are four PDF nets of icosahedral globes. Black-and-white ones
and colour ones are provided; I also provide a version with the
poles at vertices of the icosahedron, and a version with the poles
at face centres. The former looks nicer, in my opinion, but the
latter has the virtue that you can stand it on a surface the right
way up. Take your pick.
