My polyhedral badger model was drawn in much the same way as my
previous animal model,
<a href="amble.html">Amble the panda</a>.
I reused essentially the same processing scripts, and simply
substituted a different set of
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a>
diagram files.

<img src="badger-feet.png" border=0>
<img src="badger-tail.png" border=0>

<p>
(The face was complicated here. The first image above is
superimposed on its reflection to get the same stripes, eye and ear
on both sides. However, the highlights in the eyes and nose are
asymmetric, so I had to draw the second image, which is not
reflected and which contains just those highlights.)

<p>
The badger model differed from Amble in that the background is filled 
in a colour other than the default white. I could probably have
hacked up an infrastructure change which made the PostScript picture
description retrieve <code>clippath</code> and fill it in the
appropriate colour; instead I simply drew an additional Dia diagram
containing a set of overlapping polygons which covered a sixth of
the sphere, then replicated it six times across the entire sphere,
and coloured all the polygons in the same mid-grey.

<p>
Also, the badger's nose detail contained stroked rather than filled
drawing, for which I had to add another few clauses to the script
that processed Dia files, to make it recognise a couple more types
of drawing object.
