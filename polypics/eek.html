Making the polyhedral part of my model of Eek! the bat was a simple
enough process after having already designed
<a href="amble.html">Amble the panda</a>
and
<a href="badger.html">my unnamed badger</a>.
My Dia processing script required only trivial tweaks to make sure
it handled colour correctly, and then it was just a matter of
drawing another set of
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a>
diagram files and defining what parts of the sphere they should be
projected on to. Having done that, <code>drawnet.py</code> produced
an entirely acceptable net of Eek!'s body.

<p>
As you can see from the first of the above images, I coloured the
background brown using the same simple approach as in the
<a href="badger.html">badger</a>.
Then there's an individual image for the ear (mirrored on each
side), the eye (copied to each side without mirroring, so the
highlights point the same way), the paw and the nose. The final
image gives one of the two teeth (and is mirrored to provide the
other one), and the mouth. I was hampered in the mouth by the
limitations of Dia, which didn't want to let me draw only a
<em>section</em> of an ellipse; so I had to draw the entire ellipse
with a black outline, and then cover the top half with another
ellipse that had no outline. Silly, but it worked.

<p>
The big challenge in making a bat is that you can't really get away
with not giving him wings. So I had to come up with a way to stick
wings on to a polyhedron, without affecting any of the artwork I had
so carefully drawn on the outside of the polyhedron, and without
compromising the solid's structural integrity.

<p>
Clearly the easiest way to attach a wing is at an edge of the
polyhedron: that's where you're already gluing things together, so
gluing something else in there as well shouldn't make matters much
worse.

<p>
After some thought, I decided the best thing to do would be to make
a double-sided wing out of two pieces of cardboard stuck back to
back (which enables it to be printed black on both sides without the
need for exciting printer technology), and give it a pair of flaps
folding out in opposite directions. Then you remove the tab which
would normally glue together the two faces meeting at the target
edge, and instead of that flap you insert your wing, with one of its
flaps glued to the inside of each of the two adjacent faces. So the
wing sticks out between the two pentagons, and holds them together
itself in place of the original flap.

<p>
So I had to tweak the net of the dodecahedron to make sure the edges
where I wanted the wings to go were cut edges rather than folded
edges. I might also usefully have pre-removed the tabs for those
edges, but in fact I didn't bother; the user can just as easily
cut them off at construction time, and doing it like that simplifies
the software considerably.

<p>
Finally, of course, I had to carefully measure the edge length of
the dodecahedron in the final net, and make sure to generate the
wings at the right size so that the attached end was exactly as long
as the dodecahedron edge.

Here's the <a href="eek.pdf">PDF net of Eek!</a>, without the wings.

<p>
Here's the <a href="eekwings.pdf">PDF of the second sheet that
generates the wings</a>. Cut all four wings out, glue them
back-to-back in pairs leaving the flaps unglued, and fold the flaps
outwards in opposite directions. Then, for each wing, remove a tab
from the dodecahedron net, and use the two flaps of the wing in 
place of that tab to hold the two pentagons together.
