<p>
When any remote tunnels are configured, there is a chance that PuTTY
will crash (or do something else bad), mostly likely after user
authentication (when tunnels are first set up). Increasing numbers of
remote tunnels is likely to increase the likelihood of a crash. This
affects both SSH-1 and SSH-2.

<p>
(This is due to <code>free()</code>-ing of an uninitialised pointer in
the event logging code. Other than the errant <code>free()</code>,
execution is not affected.)
