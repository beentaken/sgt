Summary: If the host key isn't saved, rekeys cause another warning
Class: bug

If the user answers "no" to the "cache host key?" prompt, they get asked
again at the next rekey.  This is a little silly -- PuTTY should remember
the host key it didn't save, and only whinge if the key has changed.

What PuTTY should do if a different key for the host has turned up in
the cache in the meantime is left as an exercise for the reader.
