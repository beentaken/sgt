<p>
The magic we use to get a drop-down list of printers for our raw ANSI
printing support doesn't work too well on all systems. You can still
type a printer name into the combo box and expect it to work. We've
received various suggested fixes, but we haven't understood / tested
them thoroughly yet. (The behaviour seems to depend on the version of
Windows, so we need to test any proposed fix on a range of versions.)

<em>Update:</em> fixed as of 2002-09-03.
