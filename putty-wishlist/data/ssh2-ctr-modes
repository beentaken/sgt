The Internet Draft
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/secsh/draft-ietf-secsh-newmodes">draft-ietf-secsh-newmodes</a>
specifies a new symmetric-encryption mode for SSH that doesn't suffer
from the flaws described in
<a href="ssh2-cbc-weakness.html">ssh2-cbc-weakness</a>.
The relevant ones
(3des-ctr, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, blowfish-ctr) are now
implemented in PuTTY.
