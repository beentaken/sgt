Summary: Better compatibility with DOS's ANSI.SYS

<p>
I've had a report that MS-DOS's old ANSI.SYS behaves differently
from PuTTY in two important respects: firstly, ESC[2J homes the
cursor as well as clearing the screen, and secondly, auto-wrap wraps
<em>immediately</em> when a character is displayed in the rightmost
column, whereas PuTTY delays the wrapping until the next character
is printed. More importantly, apparently old ANSI.SYS-using
applications depend on both of these behaviours.

<p>
Neither of these should be PuTTY's default - they would break plenty
of more modern applications - but setting them as configurable
options would be nice.
