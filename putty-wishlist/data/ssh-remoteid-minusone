Summary: Remote channel numbers of 0xffffffff will confuse PuTTY

Within ssh.c, PuTTY uses a server channel number of (unsigned)(-1) to
represent a channel that doesn't have a server channel number assigned
yet.  Neither SSH1 nor SSH2, though, places any restriction on the use
of 0xffffffff as a channel number, which is what (unsigned)(-1) will
be on a 32-bit system.  If a server using 0xffffffff as a channel
number, PuTTY will not believe that the channel is properly open, and
will, for instance, die with a fatal error if the server tries to
close it.
