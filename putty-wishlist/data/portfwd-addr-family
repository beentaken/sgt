Summary: Unix listening sockets (e.g., tunnels) are IPv6-only by default
Class: bug

<p>
On a Unix system supporting IPv6, PuTTY will by default create
listening sockets (e.g. for the local end of a local-to-remote tunnel)
as IPv6-only. Attempts to connect to the port using IPv4 addresses
(127.0.0.1) will fail, and often the same problem will occur with the
name "localhost". This occurs for instance on Ubuntu Linux
(so this is probably what's behind
<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/putty/+bug/67488">LP
#67488</a>).

<p>
This contradicts the
<a href="http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ssh-portfwd-address-family">documentation</a>
of the default "Auto" setting for tunnels, which states that "ticking
'Auto' should always give you a port which you can connect to using
either protocol."

<p>
Unix PuTTY should ensure that listening sockets are valid for at least
the address families specified in the configuration.

<p>
Workarounds:
<ul>
<li>Explicitly configure PuTTY to use an IPv4 listening socket (change
'Auto' to 'IPv4'). Of course, you won't then be able to connect to the
tunnel endpoint with IPv6.
<li>Leave the PuTTY configuration as it is, but explicitly connect to
the IPv6 localhost address (<tt>::1</tt>).
</ul>
