<p>
The PSFTP and PSCP tools more or less entirely ignore the
<code>-load <i>session</i></code> option.

<p>
They unconditionally clobber the loaded details with
<code>do_defaults()</code>, either from another session or Default
Settings.

<p>
This probably crept in when <code>-load</code> was made non-deferred.
Fixed in CVS.
