Summary: Generic key mapping facility

We've resisted introducing generalised key remapping for some time,
on the grounds that it's just too horrible, and also on the grounds
that if we introduce a scripting language then key remapping could
appear as a side benefit of that.

<p>
However, since scripting now looks likely to be a DLL plugin if
it even happens at all, and since more and more people have written
to tell us that there are more configurations in use for the
function keys than we could possibly have dreamed of, I think we're
eventually going to have to get round to doing a proper key
remapping facility.

<p>
The major difficulty in this is that we want PuTTY to end up
portable to other operating systems. So we're somehow going to have
to split the keyboard processing down the middle, so that we have a
platform-dependent half which converts Windows keyboard messages
into a set of PuTTY standard key and modifier names, and then a
platform-generic half which maps our standard key names into actual
character sequences to be sent to the host.
