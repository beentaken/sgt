Summary: Logging settings are not saved with Default Settings

Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: fun
Priority: medium

Currently the session logging settings are deliberately excluded when
saving to "Default Settings".

A workaround is to hack the Registry.

This has been the case ever since proper logging was added. We suspect
this is by design, and dates from before we had effective mechanisms
to prevent log file clashes (the prompt-before-overwriting and the
dynamic log-file name selection).
