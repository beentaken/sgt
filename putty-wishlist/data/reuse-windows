Summary: Ability to re-use dead session windows

<p>
Perhaps an inactive window should have a menu option to reactivate
the session (like Duplicate Session but in the same window).

<p>
We've had one request for a "Duplicate + Kill" option. Perhaps this
would be a sensible behaviour if the new "reconnect" option were
invoked on a live session. (With suitable prompting, of course.)

<p>
(Some people would like this to happen
<a href="reconnect-auto.html">automatically</a>.)
