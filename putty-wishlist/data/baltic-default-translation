Summary: Change default charset for Baltic Windows from Latin-4 to Latin-7
Class: wish
Difficulty: fun
Priority: low
Fixed-in: 2003-10-08

<p>
From a correspondent in <code>.lt</code> (2003 Jul 25):

<blockquote>
Default codepage for Baltic languages (Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian)
should be ISO 8859-13 (Latin-7) instead of current PuTTY's default ISO
8859-4 (Latin-4). ISO 8859-4 is deprecated, and Windows Baltic codepage
(CP1257) is basically ISO 8859-13 with several control symbols.

<p>
ISO 8859-13 is the standard codepage in Latvia and Lithuania. I think
ISO 8859-15 is standard in Estonia, but this codepage was standartized
only recently, and in Windows, CP1257 is still Estonia's default.

<p>
Since we don't know any better, this change is implemented as of
2003-10-08.
