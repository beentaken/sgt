Subject: Remote terminal spew can lock out local GUI

<p>
If the remote server floods us with terminal data enthusiastically
enough, the local GUI can be completely locked out (at least on
Windows). The appearance is that PuTTY appears to hang: it consumes as
much CPU as it can, the window does not update, and the GUI (keyboard,
menus etc) is unresponsive. If and when the stream of data abates,
PuTTY becomes responsive again.

This crept in somewhere between 0.57 and 0.58.
