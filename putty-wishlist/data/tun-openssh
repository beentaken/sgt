Summary: OpenSSH-compatible tun VPN support

<p>OpenSSH has a crude VPN system based on sending raw IP packets over
an SSH channel.  We're unlikely to implement this in PuTTY because:
<ul><li>The protocol appears to have no documentation other than the OpenSSH
source code.
<li>From what we've been able to work out of the protocol from the sources,
it's ugly and depends on the boundaries between network packets being
represented by boundaries between SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA messages.
</ul>
