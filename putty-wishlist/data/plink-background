Summary: Plink option to background after authentication

OpenSSH has a "-f" option which causes it to fork into the background after
authentication.  Plink should probably have this too.  Its implementation
wouldn't be terribly complex on Unix, though it would need an "authentication
complete" callback from the backend.  I have no idea about Windows.
