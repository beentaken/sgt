<p>
Most of PuTTY's backends support some sort of "break" signal.
Currently, the only way to send this signal is via the "Special
Commands" menu. While it is possible to access this from the keyboard
with appropriate configuration, it isn't very convenient. Many people
would have a use for a more convenient shortcut, especially since the
addition of <a href="serial-backend.html">serial line support</a>.

<p>
The traditional key sequence for sending this signal from a PC keyboard
is Ctrl-Break. Currently, this sends ^C in PuTTY. It doesn't seem like
a great loss to reassign it to sending a "break" signal.

<p>
The previous behaviour of the Ctrl-Break key sequence can be accessed
using Ctrl-C.
