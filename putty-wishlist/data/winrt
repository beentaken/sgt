Summary: Port PuTTY to Windows RT (aka Metro)

Various people have asked us for a port of PuTTY to Windows RT so that it
could run on the "Metro" side of Windows 8 and thus on Microsoft's ARM-based
"Surface" tablets.

A WinRT port of PuTTY would be a lot of work.  The platform
independent code would probably work mostly unmodified, but you would
have to implement all the platform-specific parts of PuTTY (the
networking abstraction, user input, terminal display and settings GUI)
in terms of the WinRT API.  Not impossible, and probably easier with
PuTTY than with many other applications, but still a lot of work.

Also, all applications to work on ARM WinRT devices have to be certified
by Microsoft and have to be `sold' through the Windows App Store.
That's likely to be a lot of faff, and Microsoft would probably want
to gouge some money from us for the privilege.  (Also I wouldn't bet on
a PuTTY port passing any kind of MS certification.)

It's something we'd like to see, but there's nothing imminently
happening.  For one thing none of us has a Windows 8 box of any CPU
persuasion at all yet!
