Summary: On Windows, IPv6 scoped addresses don't work
Content-type: text/plain
Priority: low
Class: bug

It's been reported that IPv6 scoped addresses, such as
fe80::200:e2ff:fe65:9ce%4, don't work correctly on Windows XP Home + XP2.
SecureCRT does work, which suggests that we might just need to invoke
getaddrinfo() differently.
