<p>It's been reported that IPv6 scoped addresses (as defined in
RFC4007), such as <code>fe80::200:e2ff:fe65:9ce%4</code>, don't work
correctly on Windows XP Home + XP2. The error is "Network error: No
route to host". SecureCRT does work, which suggests that we might
just need to invoke <code>getaddrinfo()</code> differently.  Scoped
addresses work on Unix (NetBSD at least).
 
<p><b>SGT, 2006-12-24</b>: Jeroen Massar, the original author of
PuTTY's IPv6 code, has supplied a patch which fixes this. Users
experiencing this bug might like to download a post-r7007 snapshot
and make sure the problem has gone away.
