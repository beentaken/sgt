Summary: Better diagnostics on failure to load private key file
Class: wish
Difficulty: fun
Priority: low
Fixed-in: 2003-08-30

Currently some failures to load private key files (PPK) result in
messages like "Couldn't load private key".

These are failures such as hash/MAC verification and format errors,
which seems wrong. A better error reporting channel would be nice.

(NB that hash/MAC verification errors will only be visible as such for
passphraseless keys, since for encrypted keys tampering is
indistinguishable from an incorrect passphrase.)
