Summary: PuTTY should support HTTP Digest authentication
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/plain

Currently, PuTTY only support HTTP Basic authentication, which involves
sending the user's password over the network in cleartext, which is Bad.
HTTP Digest authentication is marginally more secure, and not ludicrously
complex, so PuTTY should probably support it.
