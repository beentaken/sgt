<p>Apparently, while PuTTY believes that SSH 2.0.* have the SSH-2 key-derivation
bug, 2.0.13 (host OS/hardware not specified) doesn't, and this causes
the expected decryption failures.  The current OpenSSH code suggests that
the bug is only present in versions before SSH 2.0.11.

<p>Ref: <code>&lt;Pine.SGI.3.96.1021008003747.69817B-100000@serdis.dis.ulpgc.es&gt;</code>

<p>Workaround: change `Miscomputes SSH2 encryption keys' on the `Bugs'
panel from `Auto' to `Off'.
