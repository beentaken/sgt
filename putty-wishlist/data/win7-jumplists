Several people have suggested that PuTTY could use Windows 7's new
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378402%28VS.85%29.aspx">Jump List</a>
feature to provide access to saved sessions.

The main reason we haven't got around to this is that it involves
farting around with COM. We'd need a way of doing this that doesn't
rely on C++ or anything else that will compromise our source-level
portability; patches meeting this criterion are more likely to be
accepted. (It should go without saying that it mustn't compromise
ability to run on older versions of Windows either.)
