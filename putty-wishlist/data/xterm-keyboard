If anyone can supply a better description, that would probably be useful.

<p>
PuTTY claims a terminal type of "xterm" by default, but doesn't actually
default to being compatible with xterm.  Even in xterm function-key mode,
PuTTY doesn't actually generate the right sequences for everything.

Of course, this is made trickier by the fact that there are many different
versions of xterm, but current XFree86 xterm seems to be considered the best
baseline by our users.  Its <code>ctlseqs.ms</code> documents things fairly
well.
