Summary: Support for ECDSA keys in PuTTY and PuTTYgen

<p>
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656">RFC 5656</a> defines
elliptic-curve (ECDSA) key formats (host and user) for use with SSH-2,
and associated ECDH key exchange methods. OpenSSH has supported these
since 5.7.

<p>
PuTTY does not currently support these. It probably should.

<p>
The only niggle I (OSD) have is that I'm not 100% sure what the patent
situation is. (Wikipedia has
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_patents">some words</a> on
the subject.)

<p>
A user reports
<!-- comp.security.ssh 13fd429a-9909-47f9-834f-c9029f742793@googlegroups.com -->
that the French government computing security agency
<a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/">ANSSI</a> has
<a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/NP_OpenSSH_NoteTech.pdf">recommendations</a>
for configuring OpenSSH that prefer use of ECDSA keys.
