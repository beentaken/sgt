Summary: Port to Gtk+-2 toolkit on Unix
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low

Currently, the Unix port of PuTTY uses the Gtk+-1.2 UI toolkit. It
would be nice if it could also support Gtk+-2.

We would require that the source still be compilable against Gtk+-1.2.

Someone is working on this.
