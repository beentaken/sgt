Summary: Printer enumeration may cause slow startup

<p>
There's been a suggestion (ref:
<tt>000c01c282b0$c6ae6c90$6e01a8c0@int.psross.net</tt>) that the ANSI
printer support added in 0.53 can cause PuTTY to take a long time to
start (~30 seconds) if a printer is configured in Windows that is not
reachable (e.g. shared from a machine that is currently switched off).
This may be intermittent rather than reliable. (Win2K Pro SP3)

<p>
We've not reproduced this so far (I've tried on Win2K pro), but a
workaround appears to be to remove the offending printers.

<p>
Alternatively, snapshots 2003-08-22 and later try less hard to find
printers and this has been reported to work.

<p>
<em>Gory details:</em>
PuTTY calls Windows functions to enumerate all suitable printers
(regardless of whether any attempt is made to <em>use</em> the ANSI
printing functionality):
<ul>
<li>when a saved session is loaded into the configuration dialog;
<li>when a new panel is selected via the treeview control;
<li>when the config dialog is initially drawn (side effect of above).
</ul>
This means that this is <em>not</em> done if the configuration dialog
is bypassed (e.g., by loading a saved session directly).

<p>
PuTTY is a bit unusual in doing this; we use EnumPrinters (etc)
directly in order to avoid UI issues associated with the concept of
`raw' printing.

<p>
I've not been able to reproduce this on Win2K Pro.

<p>
This is to some extent not our problem, but perhaps we could do
something to mitigate the problem (e.g. enumerate printers less often
/ only if the user requests the ANSI printing functionality).

<p>
<em>Alternative fix:</em> use a different type of printer enumeration
which doesn't try so hard. Patch:
<code>yehhebmmpfq.fsf@ocean.cs.brown.edu</code>. Dependent on Windows
version, so need to ensure the functionality still works across at
least the Win95-series and WinNT-series.

<p>
In detail, we should use <code>PRINTER_INFO_4</code> where possible,
rather than <code>PRINTER_INFO_1</code> which apparently calls
<code>OpenPrinter()</code> for every printer. However, <code>_4</code>
is only available on NT-class systems; the suggestion is that we
detect the Windows version and use <code>_5</code> on 95-class systems -
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a8uted%24vc87k%241%40ID-106075.news.dfncis.de">Usenet</a>
corroborates this approach. (We're <em>already</em> avoiding
<code>_5</code> on NT because we had problems enumerating network
printers.) Yuk.

<p>
<em>Update 2003-02-26:</em> verified that <code>PRINTER_INFO_4</code>
on Win2K SP2 and <code>PRINTER_INFO_5</code> on Win98 work as least as
well for me as what we do currently (<code>PRINTER_INFO_1</code>). All
that remains is the tedious mucking around with version detection.

<p>
<em>Update 2003-08-22:</em> finally got round to implementing this, and
got a report that it works.
