<p>Resizing the window is still pretty flaky. One particular current
problem is: if you choose a font that fits 80 columns on your screen
but not 132, then sending ESC[?3h to switch to 132-column mode will
squish the font just enough to fit 132 columns in a full-width
window. So far so good; but when you send ESC[?3l to return to 80
columns, really it would be nice if the window was put back the way
it started out. Also there's some indication that the squishing
doesn't work quite right; first PuTTY expands the window to full
width, then it chooses a font size, and then it leaves a big border
down each side of the window when that font size fails to fit quite
right. Really it should recompute the window size once it knows the
font size.
