<p>
Some people have reported that PuTTY's default mouse pointer (the Windows
I-beam) appears black-on-black, and is hence invisible.  It usually consists
entirely of inverted pixels, and hence should appear white on PuTTY's default
black background.

<p>
There have been sporadic reports of this for years, but they have become
more frequent recently (2007), particularly associated with Windows Vista
(but also
<a href="http://osdir.com/ml/network.rdesktop.user/2005-03/msg00012.html">reported with rdesktop</a>).
Some possible causes:
<ul>
<li>
Perhaps on some installations, the I-beam pointer is black, rather than
inverted. This wouldn't be very obvious with most Windows applications,
with their light-coloured backgrounds, but would be obvious with PuTTY's
default black background. We haven't personally seen this one, so it's
pure speculation; please let us know if it turns out to be the case for
you.
<li>
Even when the cursor <em>is</em> inverted, some video cards have an
off-by-one error. In this case, a tiny change to PuTTY's background colour
can help. See below. (We have had several reports where this did not
help.)
</ul>

<p>
In all cases, changing the Windows I-beam cursor to something chunkier
(via Control Panel / Mouse / Pointers or similar) should give you
something usable.

From SGT:
<blockquote>
<p>
I've seen this same problem personally on a GeForce2MX, and I
investigated it carefully. I believe it is a bug in the GeForce2MX
video driver. The I-beam cursor is supposed to invert whatever
colour is underneath it, but it mistakenly inverts black to black.
(My suspicion is that each RGB value x is mapped to 256-x instead of
255-x, or some equally easy typo.)
<p>
Perhaps complaining to the video card manufacturer (assuming it's
them who wrote the driver) might be a good first step? I haven't
heard of anyone else who's had this problem doing so...
<p>
What I did to solve this myself was to design my own replacement
I-beam mouse pointer, which was white with a black outline so as to
show up on any kind of background. The video driver was quite happy
with that one.
<p>
If anybody else has this problem, they should try reconfiguring
their PuTTY colour scheme so that black is RGB 1,1,1 instead of RGB
0,0,0. I <em>suspect</em> that that will make the problem go away;
if so, that would confirm my theory about its cause.
