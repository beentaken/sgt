Some people have reported that PuTTY's default mouse pointer (the Windows
I-beam) appears black-on-black, and is hence invisible.  It usually consists
entirely of inverted pixels, and hence should appear white on PuTTY's default
black background.  Reports so far:

I (BJH) have some memory of Simon mentioning having seen this problem before,
and it having turned out to be a bug in the video card/driver.  At present,
I think we need more information on systems where this problem occurs, and
in particular what operating system, video card, driver version and colour
depth are being used.
