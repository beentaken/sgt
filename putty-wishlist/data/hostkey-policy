Summary: Enhanced flexibility in SSH host key lookup policy

<p>
PuTTY's host key lookup policy is extremely simple at the moment. The
name under which a host key is filed in the Registry is exactly the
name you typed into the Hostname box. This avoids ever trusting the
DNS for anything. The choice of which key to use is also very simple -
we have a fixed preference order of RSA, DSS (for SSH-2).

<p>
Recent versions of OpenSSH appear to file keys under IP addresses as
well, although I've never stopped to work out what the semantics of
this is. (Is a key considered valid only if it appears from the same
host name _and_ IP address, or if it appears from either, or what?)
It might be good to sit down and work out what OpenSSH's policy
actually is, and wonder whether we want to implement it in PuTTY.

<p>
For the benefit of <em>really</em> weird network setups, it would be
nice to be able to explicitly <em>specify</em> what name to store a
host key under. (For example, if you're connecting through an SSH
port forwarding to the SSH port of another machine, and you've
previously connected directly to the same machine, then really you
want to be looking the host key up under the same name as it was
already stored. You almost certainly <em>don't</em> want to
permanently associate that host key with the temporary port number
on your local machine which you've chosen for the forwarding.)

<ul>
<li>Silly idea: if you select Telnet proxying and a completely empty
command string, the effect is that PuTTY will connect to the address
specified in the Proxy panel, but will believe itself to be connecting
to the address specified in the Session panel. Result: it will cache
the host key under the latter name.
</ul>

<p>
When there's a choice of host keys available for a host, perhaps PuTTY
should adjust its stated preferences so that the ones it has cached
come first. Need to think about that a bit. At the very least, when a
new host key prompt is given, PuTTY should mention if it already has
host keys for a host in other formats - particularly important when
the <a href="ssh2-default.html">default protocol changes to SSH-2</a>,
or a server that previously offered DSS keys starts supporting RSA
too.
