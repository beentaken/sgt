Summary: Cannot use dynamic port-forwarding with specific IP protocol in saved session
Class: bug

<p>
In PuTTY 0.63 (but not older or newer releases), it's not possible to
create a saved session with a dynamic SOCKS tunnel bound to a specific
protocol (IPv4 or IPv6).

<p>
A dynamic port forwarding setting in a PuTTY session saved in 0.62 or
before can fail to work in 0.63, if it explicitly specifies 'IPv4'
or 'IPv6', with a message like 'Service lookup failed for source port
"D8080"' in the Event Log.

<p>
Also, creating a fresh dynamic tunnel specifying IPv4/IPv6 and saving
it in a session with 0.63 yields a saved session with a non-working
tunnel (here you'd see 'Service lookup failed for source port "L8080"'
in the Event Log). The tunnel only works as specified if the session
is launched immediately after it is configured (but even then you see
the nonsense string "DL8080" in the settings dialog).

<p>
Dynamic tunnels with the 'Auto' protocol setting (the default) are not
affected by any of this.

<p>
After installing a fixed version of PuTTY, any affected sessions that
were originally created with 0.63 will need to have the relevant
dynamic tunnels removed, re-added, and re-saved.
