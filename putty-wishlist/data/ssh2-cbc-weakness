<p><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/996943.996945">Bellare
<i>et al</i></a> describe a weakness in the use of CBC-mode ciphers in SSH-2.
Section 9.2.1 of the current secsh-architecture draft suggests emitting an
SSH_MSG_IGNORE before each real packet, which I think converts Bellare
<i>et al</i>'s SSH-IPC into something analogous to SSH-CTRIV-CBC or
SSH-EIV-CBC.

<p>Implementing this in PuTTY was fairly easy, and gives us decent
security until CTR modes are widespread.  It does, though, add something
like 32 bytes of overhead to each SSH packet in CBC mode.
