Summary: Command-line option to edit a session rather than launching it

From a user:

The feature I request would be a "-edit my_session" command line option.
This option would open the PuTTY control panel, with the session
"my_session" preloaded.
(Like TuTTY does ;)

And why not a "-delete my_session" command line option, that could do what
it says (with a confirmation dialog) ?
