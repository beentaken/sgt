Terminal settings that are modifiable from "Change Settings" but
which only control an <em>initial</em> state should be handled
better. Perhaps a sensible procedure would be that if the user
changes such a setting, then when they hit Apply they get a message
box: "You have modified the initial state of the Foo setting. This
change will take effect the next time your terminal is reset. Do you
want to force it to take effect immediately as well? [yes] [no]".
