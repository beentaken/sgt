<p>
Terminal settings that are modifiable from "Change Settings" but
which only control an <em>initial</em> state should be handled
better. Perhaps a sensible procedure would be that if the user
changes such a setting, then when they hit Apply they get a message
box: "You have modified the initial state of the Foo setting. This
change will take effect the next time your terminal is reset. Do you
want to force it to take effect immediately as well? [yes] [no]".

<p>
<b>SGT, 2003-01-14</b>: Recent code cleanups had the side effect of
allowing me to detect changes in these features, so I arranged that
the current state automatically gets updated when you change such a
feature in mid-session. I didn't bother with the message box; it
seemed excessive for such a small thing.

<p>
Just for reference, at the time of fixing, the full list of such
features is: auto wrap mode, DEC origin mode, background-colour
erase, whether blinking text really blinks, and the character
classes for double-click word-at-a-time selection.
