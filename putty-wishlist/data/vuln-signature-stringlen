<p>
Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.63 have an integer overflow
vulnerability in their treatment of string length fields in public-key
signatures.

<p>
An RSA signature blob contains a multiprecision integer stored as an
SSH-2 string, i.e. with a 4-byte length field at the front. Setting
this length field to 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) is mistakenly permitted by the
signature decoding code due to a missing bounds check, and the effect
is that PuTTY allocates zero memory to store the integer in (because
it adds one to the length first) and then tries to write zeroes over
4Gb of memory starting from that location.

<p>
This bug applies to any RSA signature received by PuTTY, including
during the initial key exchange phase. Therefore, this bug can be
exploited by a malicious server, <em>before</em> the client has
received and verified a host key signature. So this attack can be
performed by a man-in-the-middle between the SSH client and server,
and the normal host key protections against MITM attacks are bypassed.
Even if you trust the server you <em>think</em> you are connecting to,
you are not safe.

<p>
We are unaware of any way in which this can lead to remote code
execution, since it will typically overwrite the entire heap with
zeroes and PuTTY is expected to crash almost immediately.

<p>
This bug does not affect DSA keys.
