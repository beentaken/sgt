Summary: Requests to Pageant should be asynchronous

<p>
Currently, when PuTTY makes a request to Pageant, it waits in a
tight loop for the answer. Really it should be able to answer
Windows messages and do other housekeeping tasks while it's waiting
for the answer. This would enable Pageant to do a variety of
time-consuming things in the course of answering a request.

done.

<b>Update, 2004-01-24</b>:
Bah! Nicolas Barry correctly points out that my async agent code
simply doesn't work - if multiple concurrent agent requests are
attempted, some of them will fail for no apparent reason. I assume
concurrent SendMessage() calls don't work in the Windows API, or
some such. So I'm commenting out the async code for the moment
(there wasn't a Windows Pageant that made helpful use of it anyway
yet) and returning to the drawing board.
