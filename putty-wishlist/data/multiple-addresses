Summary: PuTTY mishandles machines with multiple addresses
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>At present, if a host has multiple addresses, PuTTY merely connects to the
first one it gets.  This is arguably incorrect behaviour, and PuTTY should
try each address in turn until it gets one that works.  My feeling is that a
Socket_Addr should be able to contain multiple addresses, and sk_new should
handle the retries, but I haven't thought out how proxying would work.
