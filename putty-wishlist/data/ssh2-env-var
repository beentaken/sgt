Summary: Support setting environment variables in SSH-2
Class: wish

<p>
SSH-2 has a mechanism for the client to set random environment
variables on the server (the <code>env</code> channel request).
Currently we don't support this.

<p>
Last time we looked, we weren't aware of any SSH servers that bothered
to support this, but that was a some time ago now.

(The SSH-1 protocol doesn't support this at all.)
