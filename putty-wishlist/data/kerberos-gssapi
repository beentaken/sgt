Summary: Support for Kerberos and GSSAPI

<p>
Somebody requested "Kerberos 5 credential forwarding". I don't know
anything about Kerberos, so if this gets done it will have to be
done by somebody who does.

<p>
The SSH 2 drafts also go on about GSSAPI a lot. I'm not sure whether
GSSAPI is the same thing as Kerberos, or a similar thing, or if one
is an implementation of the other, or what; but it sounds as if it
covers roughly the same ground, and we probably ought to support it
at some point.
