<p>
Somebody requested "Kerberos 5 credential forwarding". I don't know
anything about Kerberos, so if this gets done it will have to be
done by somebody who does.

<p>
In SSH2, Kerberos is supported through
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/kerberos-faq/general/section-84.html">
GSSAPI</a>.  It appears that Globus <a href="http://www.globus.org/security/">
GSI</a> authentication also uses GSSAPI, though for some reason needs
a different client implementation (and yet a third if you want to support
both).

<P><a href="http://www.certifiedsecuritysolutions.com/">Certified Security
Solutions</a> have a
<a href="http://www.certifiedsecuritysolutions.com/downloads.html">patched
version of PuTTY</a> which supports Kerberos and GSSAPI.
