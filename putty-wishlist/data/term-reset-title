Summary: Perhaps terminal resets should reset window title(s)

<p>
It might be nice if terminal resets (such as <tt>ESC c</tt>) caused
the window and icon titles to revert to some default (whatever was
configured in the session?). This might be generous to people who
<a href="../faq.html#faq-wintitle">trash their terminal</a>.

<p>
<tt>xterm</tt> doesn't do this, but it probably isn't going to upset
any applications.
