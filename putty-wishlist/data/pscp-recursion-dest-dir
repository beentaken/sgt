Summary: PSCP recursive copy to a new directory tries to copy all files over that dir
Class: bug

<p>
If I try to copy a whole directory to an SFTP server using a command
of the form <code>pscp -r srcdir desthost:destdir</code>, where
<code>destdir</code> does not already exist on the destination host, I
would like to end up with <code>destdir</code> existing and being an
exact copy of <code>srcdir</code>.

<p>
Instead, what happens is that PSCP creates <code>destdir</code> but
then tries to copy every file from <code>srcdir</code> over the top of
it, i.e. it attempts to open <code>destdir</code> as a file repeatedly
rather than opening <code>destdir/file1</code>,
<code>destdir/file2</code> and so on.
