Summary: Arbitrary restriction on number of forwarded ports
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: medium

Pinched from the `Common error messages' section of the docs:

<blockquote>
<p>
10.3 "Out of space for port forwardings"

<p>
PuTTY has a fixed-size buffer which it uses to store the details of all port
forwardings you have set up in an SSH session. If you specify too many port
forwardings on the PuTTY or Plink command line and this buffer becomes full,
you will see this error message.

<p>
We need to fix this (fixed-size buffers are almost always a mistake) but we
haven't got round to it. If you actually have trouble with this, let us know
and we'll move it up our priority list.

<p>
If we implemented <a href="portfwd-range.html">`portfwd-range'</a>
then the need to fix this would become less pressing.
