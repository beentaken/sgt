<p>
It's possible that a screen-clear should push the previous screen
contents into the scrollback, rather than losing it completely.

<b>SGT, 2003-03-07</b>: Thanks to Richard Boulton for a patch doing
just this. In addition, his patch also arranges that when an
application switches to the alternate screen, the previous contents
of the primary screen are <em>temporarily</em> pushed into the
scrollback, so you can check what you were doing just before starting
the application. When the primary screen is restored, those lines
come back out of the scrollback.
