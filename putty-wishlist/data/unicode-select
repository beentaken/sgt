Summary: Word-at-a-time selection configuration ignores Unicode
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Currently, the `character classes' configuration on the Selection
panel for word-at-a-time selection only covers the first 128
characters. It did not change when PuTTY was upgraded to Unicode.

<p>
It should probably support configurable selection for Unicode somehow,
but clearly the UI will need major changes.

<p>
Currently there is some hard-coded wordness for Unicode that tries to
do the right thing for particular Unicode ranges, in
<code>terminal.c:wordtype()</code>. Perhaps the data structure here
could be used as the basis of a simple UI. (Will need to translate
existing configurations, of course.)
