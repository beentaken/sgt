Summary: Create directories for log files automatically
Class: wish
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: medium
Content-type: text/html

<p>It would be good if PuTTY, when creating logfiles, could create any
required parent directories if they don't already exist.  This is mostly
required for the case where the directory name includes some substitutions.
Indeed, it might be reasonable to only create the directory if it's
generated by a substitution.
