Summary: Pageant -c continues even if key load fails

A user reports:

Is there any way you can modify pageant to allow the -c command only to run
if the key passed on the command line loaded successfully? This is the
behaviour implied by the manual:


You can arrange for Pageant to start another program once it has initialised
itself and loaded any keys specified on its command line. This program
(perhaps a PuTTY, or a WinCVS making use of Plink, or whatever) will then be
able to use the keys Pageant has loaded.

You do this by specifying the -c option followed by the command, like this:

C:\PuTTY\pageant.exe d:\main.ppk -c C:\PuTTY\putty.exe

However it continues to run the -c command even if the key fails to load
(say if I press "cancel" when asked for a passphrase or even if the key file
does not exist).
