Summary: Toolbar on the PuTTY window

<p>
The PuTTY window could have a toolbar, containing copy and paste
buttons, a close button, new-session and duplicate-session, start
and stop logging, perhaps a drop-down list to select and start a
saved session.

This would certainly be a configurable feature, if we do it at all.
PuTTY's minimalist use of screen space is valuable to a number of
its users. But other people might find it useful.
