Summary: Bidirectional text support
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: taxing
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
If you use Unicode mode and attempt to display text in a
right-to-left script such as Hebrew or Arabic, PuTTY gets somewhat
confused. It has no internal awareness of which text should be
displayed right-to-left, so it will feed an Arabic string straight
to the Windows text display function and assume that the characters
go left to right. Apparently this will in fact not happen - TextOut
will reverse the string and show it right-to-left. On the surface
this will look like a plausible result, except that if you then move
the cursor across the text it will change, revealing that PuTTY's
beliefs about what characters Windows displayed where don't match
reality.

<p>
Proper support for this will need to involve a properly thought out
design for how a VT-series terminal should support bidirectional
text. For a start this will require research into how existing
Unicode-enabled VT-series terminal emulators do it, and how big the
software support base for those is.

<p>
(Also we'll need to find out exactly what algorithm the Windows text
display functions use to lay out their output, so that once we know
exactly what we want the window to look like we can be sure it
really does look like that. This won't be easy either.)

Some time ago, we came to the conclusion that 
<a href="http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ECMA-048.HTM">ECMA-48</a>,
in the course of defining VT-series-ish terminals, defines how such
terminals should support bi-directional text, while
<a href="http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/TECHREP/E-TR-053.HTM">ECMA TR/53</a>
nicely encapsulates all the bidi-specific bits in a (more)
understandable format, gives examples, etc. Of course, we don't know
whether anyone <em>really</em> implements it this way.

<p>
<a href="http://www.arabeyes.org/">ArabEyes</a> currently has a 
<a href="http://www.arabeyes.org/project.php?proj=PuTTY">project</a>
to add bidi support and Arabic shaping to PuTTY.
