Summary: StickyKeys inverts sense of capslock on WinXP and Win2k3
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.53b, 0.54
Content-type: text/plain

On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, if the PuTTY window has focus
and StickyKeys is activated (e.g. by holding down a modifier key or
tapping Shift five times) and then disabled, the case of characters
typed in the PuTTY window is inverted.

To reproduce:

* Log in to a system. Keep focus on the PuTTY window.
* Press shift repeatedly until the 'StickyKeys' dialogue box comes up.
* Click 'Cancel' to turn off StickyKeys.
* Now type in the PuTTY window. Letters appear in the opposite case
  they should be (capital without shift, lower case with shift, and
  reversed if caps lock is on).
* Do the 'StickyKeys' thing again to get back to normal.

OSD: I can't now reproduce this with XP SP2 and any version of PuTTY
including the versions it was originally reported against.
