Summary: Discard sensitive material in Pageant on hibernation
Difficulty: fun
Class: wish
Priority: low

<p>
It's been suggested that Pageant (and anything else storing private
key material long-term) should forget (wipe) all its unencrypted keys
when a system hibernates, to avoid them being stored to disk; it
should at least reload the keys and ask for passphrases again after a
hibernation.
Apparently the windows messages BT_APMQUERYSUSPEND and PBT_APMSUSPEND
would be useful here.

<p>
Low priority because:
<ul>
<li>
If you have physical access to the machine, then you've compromised
its security <em>anyway</em>; you can just install a trojan pageant which will
happily snarf the passphrases from keys for you, or perpetrate any one
of a number of other attacks.
</li>
<li>
Pageant doesn't currently attempt to prevent key material being
written to disk. (We don't for instance use VirtualLock(); see the
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#A.7.4">FAQ</a>.)
</li>
</ul>
