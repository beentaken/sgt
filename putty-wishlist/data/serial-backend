<p>
Extra back end to connect to a serial port instead of a Telnet or SSH
connection.

<p>
Need to think about how this fits into our UI - unlike every other
backend so far, serial connections have neither hostname nor port,
and other connections don't have stop bits and guff like that.

<p>
<a href="http://putty.dwalin.ru/">TuTTY</a> has a serial backend patch.

<a href="win-command-prompt.html#puttycyg">`win-command-prompt'</a>.

<p>
Workaround: you could use third-party software to turn the serial
connection into a telnet connection. Some possibilities include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/steve/software/wconsd.c">wconsd</a>,
for NT-class Windows systems.
<ul><li>Someone's suggested a
<a href="ftp://ftp.h07.org/pub/h07.org/projects/system/wconsd-0.1.zip">patched version</a>
that's funkier in some way.</ul>
<li><a href="http://www.elifulkerson.com/projects/telnet-serial-bridge.php">tsb</a>,
which apparently works on Win9x/Me as well.
<li><a href="http://www.digibit.org/phpBB2/dload.php?action=category&cat_id=1">NET2COM</a>, also for Windows.
<li><a href="http://ser2net.sourceforge.net/">ser2net</a>, for Unix.
</ul>

<b>SGT, 2006-08-28</b>: I believe this is basically there now.
