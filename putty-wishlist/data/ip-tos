Summary: Use of IP type-of-service field

<p>
We've had a very few requests for the PuTTY suite to make use of the
IP type-of-service (ToS) field - apparently it does make a practical
difference to a few people using traffic shapers to sort
interactive/bulk traffic.

<p>
Some thought needs to be given to this: PuTTY terminal sessions are
obviously `interactive' traffic, PSCP/PSFTP are `bulk', but Plink
could be either depending on usage, as could random port-forwardings,
so it would probably need to be configurable.

(which indicates that on Win2K, a registry entry needs to be set to
allow user programs to set the ToS).

<p>
This probably can't be set on Windows &lt;2000. Also, not sure how
this interacts with DiffServ.
