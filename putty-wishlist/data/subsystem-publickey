<p>
<a href="http://www.vandyke.com/">VanDyke</a> are pushing an
implementation-independent subsystem <code>publickey</code>
(previously <code>publickey@vandyke.com</code>)
for the distribution of public keys over SSH-2 connections. See
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-publickey-subsystem-01.txt">draft-ietf-secsh-publickey-subsystem-01</a>
(current at time of writing).

<p>
We get quite a lot of mail from people having trouble setting up PK on
their server. Perhaps we should have some form of support for this, on
general principles of encouraging public-key auth. Need to think about
what form it would take.

<p>
VanDyke have implementations (their own software, and a 
<a href="http://www.vandyke.com/download/os/pks_form.html">patch for OpenSSH</a>).
I don't know whether anyone else does.
