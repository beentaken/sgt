Summary: Add path to PuTTY programs to PATH in Windows installer

<p>
We occasionally get asked to add an option in the Windows installer
package to add the command-line programs such as PSCP and Plink to the
system <tt>PATH</tt>.

<ul>

<li>
On Win95/98/Me, this probably involves automatically modifying
<tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt>, which is probably not something we want to go
anywhere near.

<li>
On NT-class systems, it's a bit better, as we can do this by
modifying a Registry entry, and even prod running programs to pick
it up. However, it's probably not possible to do this in a
reversible way, so it would probably stay on the <tt>PATH</tt>
even after uninstallation, which is bad. (We haven't actually
<em>tried</em> this yet.)

</ul>
