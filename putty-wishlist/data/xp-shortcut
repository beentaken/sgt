Summary: Trouble creating PuTTY shortcuts in WinXP
Class: wish
Priority: low
Fixed-in: 0.53

<p>
Many people have reported that bad things happen to @ signs in
shortcut (.LNK) files under Windows XP. No-one has been able to find a
way of quoting them yet. This makes use of shortcuts with PuTTY
problematic.

<p>
This obviously isn't a bug in PuTTY per se, but it might be nice if we
could characterise the problem, and publish a workaround in the FAQ
(possibly by extending PuTTY's command-line syntax).

<p>
As of 0.53, the <code>@session</code> syntax is deprecated in favour
of <code>-load session</code>. There should be no reason to use an @
sign in a shortcut any more.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> for anyone interested in the original problem, it's been
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=f77d8eda.0310200521.242ab7fc%40posting.google.com">claimed</a>
that putting two spaces between command and argument works (i.e.,
<pre>putty  @mysession</pre>). We still recommend using
<code>-load</code>.
