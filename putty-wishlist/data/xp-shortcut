Summary: Trouble creating PuTTY shortcuts in WinXP
Class: wish
Priority: low

<p>
Many people have reported that bad things happen to @ signs in
shortcut (.LNK) files under Windows XP. No-one has been able to find a
way of quoting them yet. This makes use of shortcuts with PuTTY
problematic.

<p>
This obviously isn't a bug in PuTTY per se, but it might be nice if we
could characterise the problem, and publish a workaround in the FAQ
(possibly by extending PuTTY's command-line syntax).

<p>
Examples of reports received so far:
<ul>
<li><tt>NDBBKAOEAFAMLKEAFJIOOEHNGDAA.guy@SiliconStrat.com</tt>
<li><tt>5.1.0.14.0.20020615214407.023a33a0@amusive.com</tt>
<li><tt>000501c2263d$190195b0$0200a8c0@quadzone.net</tt>
</ul>

<p>
As of 0.53, the <code>@session</code> syntax is deprecated in favour
of <code>-load session</code>. There should be no reason to use an @
sign in a shortcut any more.
