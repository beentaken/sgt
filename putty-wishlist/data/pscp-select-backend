Summary: Ability to explicitly select SCP/SFTP backend in PSCP

<p>
It would sometimes be useful for users to be able to explicitly select
the backend that PSCP uses, with command-line options <code>-scp</code>
and <code>-sftp</code>.

<p>
As a side effect, <code>-sftp</code> could easily make PSCP look
harder for an SFTP server, in the same way that PSFTP does currently.
(But the only reason it can't always do this is a grotty
implementation detail which will be swept away come the revolution.)
