<p>Apparently, while PuTTY believes that SSH 2.0.1[01]* have the SSH-2
key-derivation bug, 2.0.11 on Solaris/SPARC 2.5.1 doesn't, and this causes
the expected decryption failures.  The current OpenSSH code suggests that
the bug is only present in versions <b>before</b> SSH 2.0.11.  It looks
like the

for
<a href="ssh2-keyderive-nonbug.html">ssh2-keyderive-nonbug</a>
had an off-by-one error.
