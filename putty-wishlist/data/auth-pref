Summary: Preference order for authentications

<p>
Ability to select a preference order of authentications, like we can
already do for ciphers.  This would be particularly useful for servers
(like OpenSSH) which limit the number of authentication attempts allowed,
since it saves us wasting attempts on methods that the user knows will
fail.  See errors-toomanyauth in the manual.

<p>
It would be nice to have some way for the user to say "skip to next
authentication method" at run-time. (Control-C? Control-D?)
