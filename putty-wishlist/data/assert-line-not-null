Summary: Bombs out with line==NULL in terminal.c
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.56
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
We receive occasional reports of PuTTY crashing out with
<code>line==NULL</code> in <code>terminal.c:lineptr()</code>.
However, we haven't been able to reproduce the problem ourselves.

<p>
In recent versions of PuTTY (0.58 and up), the error takes the form
of one or more error boxes saying "line==NULL in terminal.c" and
giving some diagnostic information, along with an exhortation to
contact us.

<p>
In versions of PuTTY before snapshot 2005-03-07, the error
is instead a failure of an assertion in <code>terminal.c</code>
that <code>line != NULL</code> (the precise line number has changed
a lot due to the extensive terminal re-engineering since 0.56).

<p>
We've had one report since we added diagnostics which indicates that
<tt>screen</tt> doesn't contain enough entries. However, we haven't
thought of a plausible mechanism for <tt>screen</tt> or
<tt>alt_screen</tt> to end up undersized.

<p>
One user (1124367194.23192.240954800@webmail.messagingengine.com)
reported a firing of the same assertion with PuTTY 0.58. However, as
their screen is apparently zero rows high (presumably due to their
window manager), this pathological case is probably a problem that's now
protected against via
<a href="zero-rows-cols-crash.html">`zero-rows-cols-crash'</a>.

<p>I am using bblean blackbox for windows as a shell on windows XP SP2, and
whenever I rollup a maximized putty window the following fatal error
results:

Perhaps an unrelated bug that's already been fixed:

  <br>2004-10-14; terminal.c:662; connecting to SunOS
  <br>reportedly fixed in 2004-10-15, although since other reports
  indicate the failure is intermittent, perhaps not
</ul>
