Improved ANSI printer control support. Squirting raw data out to a
random printer is all very well for people who already have their
remote application configured with a driver for their specific
printer, but not ideal if you just want to send a text file and have
it print in a sensible sort of way. I'd like an alternative printing
mode using the Windows graphical printing API (where the printing
application has to draw on the page like a canvas), doing the layout
myself. Advantages include being able to guarantee the right number
of columns and rows per page, being able to let the user select
portrait/landscape, and possibly also doing some escape-sequence
parsing on the input data stream to handle a variety of simple
control codes (DEC/ANSI and PCL both spring to mind, and I think the
simple ones of these could both be supported at once without clashes
requiring user-level configuration).

This is certainly going to be a large piece of code, so if it
happens at all it will want to be a plugin DLL using the plugin
interface.

In the meantime, if you have something which will emulate your
favourite printer language (e.g. Ghostscript for Postscript), you can
try bolting it on to PuTTY with something like
