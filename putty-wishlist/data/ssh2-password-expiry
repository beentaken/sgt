Summary: Support for SSH-2 password expiry mechanisms
Class: semi-bug
Priority: high
Difficulty: fun
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
PuTTY doesn't currently support the password expiry mechanisms
represented in <code>draft-ietf-secsh-userauth-16</code> by
<code>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PASSWD_CHANGEREQ</code> et al.

<p>
Old versions of the 
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~dtucker/openssh/">OpenSSH password
expiry patches</a> used to use this mechanism, but I believe that
newer versions (including the version that was incorporated in OpenSSH
3.8) don't.

<p>
According to a message on IETF secsh, VanDyke's Windows server
uses these messages. There is a VMS server which uses them too.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-03-10:</em> I've been working on this, but the
work has highlighted some changes needed in the structure of the
authentication code. Since this will be rather disruptive, we
probably won't resume work on this until after 0.58.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-10-31:</em> the disruptive changes alluded to
above have finally been made (r6437), so this should now be
feasible.
