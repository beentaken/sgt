Summary: Option to use GUI dialogs for authentication

<p>
Several people have asked for password/passphrase prompts etc to
appear in dialogue boxes in Plink and/or PuTTY, rather than inlined
into the terminal output. There are a couple of good reasons you might
want to do this.

<p>
For instance, if you're using Plink with CVS but not using
passphraseless keys or Pageant, the interface for typing your password
is less than ideal (you have to find the relevant command window and
type blind into it, apparently).

<p>
Similarly if we ever get a Plink/PuTTY mode where no terminal session
is required (e.g. it's used for forwarding only).

<p>
Also, GUI popups provide some degree of assurance against spoofing
attacks; with password/passphrase prompts in the same terminal window
as everything else, it's not always easy to be sure that your password
is going where you expect, whereas a dialog box is somewhat harder
to spoof. (Although we need to clearly distinguish local prompts such
as key passphrases from remote prompts, especially keyboard-interactive,
where the server would like to control as much of the prompt window
as possible. Not sure of the best way to do this yet.)

<p>
On Windows, Plink can create dialog boxes despite being a console-mode
program. On Unix, we wouldn't want to add a dependency to Gtk to Plink
just for this; we can probably implement the <code>ssh-askpass</code>
interface, although it would look a bit naff (existing passphrase
requesters mention OpenSSH in the dialog caption, and only allow one
prompt at a time).
<ul>
<li>For reference, the <code>ssh-askpass</code> interface is rather
simple: a prompt (may contain newlines) is optionally passed in as
the first argument, the passphrase is spit out on stdout with a
newline, and exit status is zero for success and non-zero for failure
or user cancellation.
</ul>

<p>
All optional, of course.
