<p>
A number of people have asked us to include a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/tools/tools/versioninfo_resource.asp"><code>VERSIONINFO</code> resource</a>
in the Windows binaries we ship, declaring a version number.
<ul>
<li>Some people find it more convenient to look at the file properties
to identify a binary than to run it.
<li>Some remote auditing tools apparently pick up on this information.
<li>Some people would like to create installers that depend on a
particular version of a PuTTY utility.
<li>It also affects <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno
Setup's</a> behaviour.
</ul>

<p>
Such a version numbering scheme needs to take into account our daily
snapshots, and thus to be updated in an automated way.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-10-05:</em> after wrestling with various toolchains,
we've finally checked in something that appears to work with the
Windows compilers we've tried. We reserve the right to back it out
if it causes trouble.

<p>
The meaning of the binary version number (e.g., 0.58.6356.0) is
described in
<tt><a href="http://svn.tartarus.org/putty/windows/version.rc2?view=markup">windows/version.rc2</a></tt>.

<p>
(The PuTTY binaries also contain XML
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sbscs/setup/application_manifests.asp">application manifests</a>
to improve appearance on Windows XP; these contain a mandatory 
four-component version number. We don't attempt to keep this in sync
with the VERSIONINFO resource. In current code this is hard-coded
to 0.0.0.0, although in some older versions it was set to 1.0.0.0.
This isn't ideal, although we don't currently know of anything that
actually looks at this version number.)
