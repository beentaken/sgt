Perhaps PSCP (and possibly Plink and PSFTP and other potential
command-line type tools) should be able to read some default
command-line options from an environment variable? Note that if we
did this we would also need to supply a negative form of
<em>every</em> option, so that a user could always choose to turn
off an option that the environment variable had turned on.
