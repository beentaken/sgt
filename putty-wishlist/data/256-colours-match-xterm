Summary: 256 colour mode does not match xterm's colours exactly

The RGB values of the colours used by the xterm 256 colour sequences
are not exactly the same as those used by xterm itself.  They probably
should be.

The 256colres.pl script in the xterm distribution generates the
relevant RGB values.

(I believe the values we use were originally from xterm; xterm's values
probably changed in patch #166, 2002/03/25.)
