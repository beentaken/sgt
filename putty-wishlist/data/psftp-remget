Summary: Restart multiple-file operations in PSFTP
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: tricky

While PSFTP supports "reget" to restart a download, and "mget" to download
multiple files, it doesn't have a "remget" to restart the download of multiple
files.  The same applies to "reput" and "mput".  The general case of restarting
a multiple-file {up,down}load is already handled by "re{get,put} -r", so that
shouldn't be a problem.
