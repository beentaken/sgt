<p>
The <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1738.txt">
<code>telnet:</code> URL scheme</a> allows for specifying a user name
and password to log in with.  PuTTY doesn't currently support these.
PuTTY should at least be capable of ignoring them if they're present, and
should preferably do something useful with them.
