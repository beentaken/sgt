Summary: Support builds for 64-bit Windows
Class: wish

<p>
It's occasionally been pointed out that PuTTY doesn't compile/run cleanly
for 64-bit Windows.

<p>
This should now be fixed. (You'll need to build with the
<code>NO_MANIFESTS</code> build flag.)

<p>
(Note that we have no plans to provide native 64-bit builds ourselves.
Even ignoring the fact that we don't have appropriate hardware/compilers,
it's not clear what advantage there is to be had from running PuTTY
in native 64-bit mode.)

<p>
<em>Update:</em> it looks like the call to <code>SetClassLong()</code>
in <code>window.c:update_mouse_pointer()</code> should also be fixed.
Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> doesn't yet
support the replacement <code>SetClassLongPtr()</code>.
