<p>
It's occasionally been pointed out that PuTTY doesn't compile/run cleanly
for 64-bit Windows.

<p>
This should now be fixed. (You'll need to build with the
<code>NO_MANIFESTS</code> build flag.)

<p>
(Note that we have no plans to provide native 64-bit builds ourselves.
Even ignoring the fact that we don't have appropriate hardware/compilers,
it's not clear what advantage there is to be had from running PuTTY
in native 64-bit mode. There is a third-party build on our
<a href="../links.html">Links page</a>.)
