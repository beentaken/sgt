Summary: Menu bar in the PuTTY window
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: fun

<p>
It might be useful for the PuTTY window to have a menu bar. This
would provide an easier way to get at the contents of the System
menu, and would have room for much more stuff (such as logging
on/off).

<p>
This would certainly be a configurable feature, if we do it at all.
PuTTY's minimalist use of screen space is valuable to a number of
its users. But other people might find it useful.
