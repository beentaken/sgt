Summary: Data transfer during SSH2 KEX causes confusion

<p>If there is data being transferred through PuTTY while the SSH2
repeat key exchange is taking place, it can confuse some servers.

<p>In the current SSH-2 protocol drafts, it's not entirely clear to
all readers what happens to the connection layer while the transport
layer is in a key exchange phase, so it isn't clear from there what
PuTTY <em>should</em> do in this situation. A good
conservative/liberal option would be to accept incoming
connection-layer packets provided we can decrypt them, and to queue
outgoing connection-layer packets until the key exchange is
completed. I can't easily imagine a standards decision that would
invalidate that behaviour.

<p>
There has been (repeated) discussion of this issue on
<a href="ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf-mail-archive/secsh/">IETF SECSH</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Thread 'Key Re-Exchange' starting 4 Apr 2001
  <li>Thread 'Some questions about "SSH Transport Layer Encryption Modes"' starting 16 Oct 2003
  <li>Thread 'data during rekey?' starting 1 Dec 2003
  <li>Thread 'Data transfer during key re-exchange' starting 25 Jun 2004
</ul>

<p>
The consensus seems have settled on the proposal above, and having
any nonblocking rekey as a protocol extension (see for instance message
<code>&lt;200310192351.h9JNpxAx004282@thunk.east.sun.com&gt;</code>),
so we don't now have much excuse for not implementing that;
but as of version -18 of the transport draft no change has been made 
to the actual documents. (See 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~jacobn/cvsweb/ssh2-kex-data.d/draft-ietf-secsh-transport-18-plus-kex-data.txt.diff?r1=1.1&r2=1.4&f=H">the current version</a>
of a proposed change to the language to make this clearer.)

<p>
People have also muttered about the receiving end continuing to accept
data encrypted using the "old" context; perhaps we'd want to keep an
eye on how much data the other end tried to encrypt with a given
context and close the connection if in our opinion it was too much.
(Although this would be rather rude if we didn't
<a href="ssh2-kex-repeat.html">request a rekey</a> first in plenty
of time.)

<p>
Symptoms of this:
<a href="http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/">ssh.com</a>'s server, which
does repeat key exchange every hour or so, will sometimes throw you
off - a common disconnect message seems to be "Protocol error:
Received 94 as newkeys". (We've also had a report of "packet too long"
from F-Secure.) This will seem intermittent.

<p>
There aren't any really satisfactory workarounds - either using SSH-1
or disabling key re-exchange will both work, but have obvious
drawbacks.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> should be fixed as of the 2004-11-25 snapshot.
