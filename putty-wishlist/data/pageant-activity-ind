Summary: Visual/aural indication of Pageant activity

<p>
When Pageant performs an action such as signing something, perhaps we
should indicate this is going on in some way - by tweaking its icon in
the system tray, or playing a sound, or something. That way, attentive
users might stand a chance of noticing unexpected activity, and could
then check an <a href="pageant-logging.html">event log</a> for
potential abuse of agent forwardings.

<p>
Not sure how exactly to animate the icon, whether it should be
different for different operations, and so on.

<p>
Some people would undoubtedly find this annoying and intrusive and
place lots of trust in their servers, so it should be configurable
off.
