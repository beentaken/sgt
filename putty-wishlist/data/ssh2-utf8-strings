Summary: SSH-2 message strings etc should be in UTF-8
Class: bug

All of the human-readable and human-supplied strings in SSH-2,
including user names, passwords, banners, and error messages, are
specified to be encoded in UTF-8.  PuTTY currently ignores this and
uses whatever character-set the terminal happens to be configured to
use instead.

Fixing this is relatively easy in PuTTY, where it's possible for the
SSH code to poke around in the terminal's state.  It's not so easy for
plink and PSFTP, which will need to gain an understanding of character
sets.
