Summary: Choice of loopback addresses for local port forwardings
Class: semi-bug
Priority: low
Difficulty: fun

<p>
Someone suggested that it might be useful to be able to specify
which loopback address PuTTY should bind to when listening on local
ports for local-to-remote port forwardings. Apparently, if you want
to, you can listen separately on 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3 and
so on.

<p>
This would be useful because it would enable the use of the normal
port numbers for forwarded services. Might be particularly handy
when forwarding SMB.

<p>
The user interface for this would probably just involve specifying
the IP address alongside the port number in the Tunnels panel:
instead of asking to forward port 3456, you'd ask for
127.0.0.2:3456.

<p>
This was implemented as of 2002-12-19.

(Apparently this is also useful for forwarding Windows Terminal
Services - see <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=99ab3348.0405241707.74fa3d6b%40posting.google.com">this posting</a>.)

<em>Update, 2004-Aug-10</em>: we've had a
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=41182cb2%240%24556%24ed2e19e4%40ptn-nntp-reader04.plus.net">report</a>
that Windows XP SP2 breaks this. (Apparently RC2 worked, but "RTM" - the
release - doesn't.)
There is a fix available from Microsoft if you ask nicely - see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;884020">MS KB 884020</a>
- and it looks like it'll be in the next service pack.
