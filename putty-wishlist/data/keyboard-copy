Summary: Should be able to copy to clipboard without mouse

It's been suggested that it should be possible to copy text to the Windows
clipboard (and equivalents) without using the mouse.  The usual Windows
idiom for this would be to move one end of the selection using the cursor
keys, and the other end with the shifted cursor keys.  Obviously imitating
this directly would be silly, since users need the cursor keys to be sent
to the server.  One possibility might be to have a separate mode, in the
style of NCSA Telnet for DOS, which uses Scroll Lock to switch into a mode
in which no data are received and the cursor keys move a local selection
cursor around.
