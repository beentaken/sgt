If SSH_AUTH_PASSWORD is disabled on an SSH-1 server (e.g. by setting
"PasswordAuthentication no" in OpenSSH), and PuTTY isn't configured
to try any other authentication type, it sends a password anyway and
reports that it failed.  It should notice from SSH_MSG_PUBLIC_KEY that
the server doesn't support password authentication, and not attempt it.
