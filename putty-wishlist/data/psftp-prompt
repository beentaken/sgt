From an e-mail:

One helpful feature of the "classic" ftp client is the
"prompt" command, which toggles interactive prompting
on multiple commands. I.e. while it is sometimes to simply
send all of *.pl, it is sometimes useful to only send a few,
but easier to just type "mput *.pl" and then answer "yes"
for those few that should be sent.
