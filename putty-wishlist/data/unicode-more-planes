Summary: Support for Unicode above U+FFFF

<p>
Currently, PuTTY only allocates 16 bits per character cell to the
Unicode code point, which only permits us to represent up to U+FFFF.
According to a correspondent (2003), "CJK users will want support for
plane 2 (and it's looking more likely that it the ideographs will
spill onto yet another plane)".

<p>
(If we implement
<a href="unicode-combining.html">Unicode combining characters</a>,
could we in principle do this with surrogates, effectively using a
UTF-16 encoding internally?)
