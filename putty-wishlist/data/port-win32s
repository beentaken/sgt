Summary: Port to Win32s

<p>
It shouldn't in principle be too difficult to arrange that PuTTY can
be built for Win32s (an extension to Windows 3.1 to let you run 32-bit
programs).

<p>
The last vaguely useful Win32s build I know of is from 1999 Nov 4, and
even then the configuration dialog didn't work. The most recent
attempt (2001 May 17) had a working config dialog, but crashed on
starting a session, and as such doesn't really represent progress.

<p>
Compiler/linker support is required for a Win32s build. At the least,
the binary must have a <code>.reloc</code> section (symptom of its not
doing so is "Invalid format"). MSVC 4 (4.1 or earlier, not 4.2 or
later) can build for Win32s with <code>/fixed:no</code>, and
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">mingw32</a> appears to be able to
build with vile dlltool hacks, although I don't think there's suitable
startup code.

<p>
Increasing use of Windows' Unicode functions may spell doom for a
Win32s port. Not sure.

<p>
Help here would be most welcome.
