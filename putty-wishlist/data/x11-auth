Summary: Authenticate with local X servers

<p>
X11 forwarding currently doesn't even attempt to authenticate with
the local X server. In order for it to do so, PuTTY would have to
know where to look for authentication data. It would be nice if this
were to happen.

<p>
It isn't obvious that this is even necessary; we've had X forwarding
in PuTTY for some months now, including in a major release, and
nobody has ever complained at the lack of this feature. It may
simply be that Windows X servers can't be bothered with local
authentication at all.
