Summary: PSFTP and PSCP can't handle big files (> 2 GB, > 4 GB)

<p>
The file transfer utilities (PSCP and PSFTP) ought to handle
really really big (&gt;2Gb) files. There have been reports
that they don't do so properly. (Apparently, on Windows, this will only
be meaningful under an NT-series OS; the 95 series inherently can't
handle more than 2Gb in any case.)

<p>
2004-04-27: One symptom we've had reported a lot recently is the error
message "Assertion failed: actuallen &lt;= len, file scp.c, line 1435"
for files &gt;2GB. As of the 2004-04-28 snapshot, there should be a
fix which will make this go away (thanks to Krzysztof Kowalczyk), but
we've not been able to test that; also note that the same error can
still occur if files <a href="pscp-size-change.html">change in size</a>.
In any case files over 4GB are <em>still</em> not supported (and this
would require some upheaval to fix).

<p>
2006-08-13: I (OSD) have checked in a pile of stuff which should allow
large file support where possible.  On Windows, this basically means
NT and above.
