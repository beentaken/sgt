<p>
PuTTY doesn't support the "arcfour" (RC4) cipher in SSH-2.  Arcfour is
notable for being sunstantially faster than any cipher that PuTTY
currently supports.  Unfortunately, the way it's specified for SSH-2,
without discarding the first 1024 bytes of keystream, it's rather
weaker than it could be (though not dangerously so).  On the other
hand, not being a CBC-mode block cipher, it doesn't suffer from the
problems described in ssh2-cbc-weakness.

<p>
Using arcfour (or any other stream cipher) in SSH-1 would be a very bad
idea.  The lack of a MAC makes it very easy for an attacker to modify
the data stream.

<b>Update:</b> Ben Harris has written an Internet-Draft (currently
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes-03.txt">draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes-03</a>)
describing a way of using Arcfour reasonably securely with SSH-2, and
PuTTY now implements this. Note that this document defines the
"arcfour256" and "arcfour128" ciphers; PuTTY still does not support
the less secure "arcfour" cipher, and we have no plans to make it
do so.

(In fact it currently only supports those ciphers under private
names defined in an earlier draft:
"arcfour256-draft-00@putty.projects.tartarus.org" and so on. If
the draft is approved, we should add the IETF names.)
