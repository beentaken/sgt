Summary: Should be able to prompt for a proxy password

Currently, proxy passwords have to be stored unencrypted in the registry, or
entered manually through the setup dialogue before every session.  It should
be possible to enter them at the time the connection is set up, like other
passwords.

This isn't entirely trivial, I fear. At the moment, every proxied
connection maps to exactly one actual network connection; there is
no provision for making a trial connection and trying again if it
doesn't work. For at least some proxy types, if the user supplies no
password we'll have to attempt the connection without a password
(because we don't want to prompt for a password when there's
<em>really</em> supposed to be no password). Then, if that fails,
we'll have to prompt for a password and try again.
