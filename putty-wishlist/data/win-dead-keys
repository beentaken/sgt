<p>
When using a keyboard layout that uses dead keys (such as German, or
US International), entering a non-composing sequence (such as a pair
of circumflexes), such that the second keypress resulted in two
characters, gave the wrong result (the second character was wrong).

<p>
Changing the <code>lpChar</code> argument of 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/UserInput/KeyboardInput/KeyboardInputReference/KeyboardInputFunctions/ToAsciiEx.asp"><code>ToAsciiEx</code></a>
from <code>WORD[]</code> to <code>BYTE[]</code>, and using a pointer
cast, makes it work properly. The documentation isn't clear what type
the storage behind the pointer should be, but Googling indicates that
this usage is not uncommon.

<p>
Fix tested on Win2K (and by a third party on WinXP).

<p>
This may sort out some other keyboard problems people have been
having, too, if we're lucky.
