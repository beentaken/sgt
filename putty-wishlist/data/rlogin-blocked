Summary: Cannot rlogin to host after uncleanly terminated connection
Class: bug

<p>
If a PuTTY rlogin connection to a given remote system is terminated
uncleanly (e.g., by closing the PuTTY window), further attempts to
rlogin to that host result in a "PuTTY Fatal Error: Network error:
Address already in use" for several minutes.

<p>
I've observed this on Win2K with Red Hat Linux i386 7.1
(in.rlogind from rsh-server-0.17-2.5). The original reporter observed
it on NT4SP6a, server OS "Linux (several versions), HP-UX (several
versions)".
