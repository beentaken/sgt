Class: bug
Priority: medium

Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>PuTTY doesn't build cleanly using GCC 4 on Unix because we turn on 
<tt>-Wall</tt> and <tt>-Werror</tt>.  Most of the problems are the
usual ones to do with signenedness of pointer targets.
Debian bug #<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/287960">287960</a> has some
details and patches.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> The 2007-01-10 snapshot compiled cleanly with GCC
4.1.2ish.
