Summary: PSCP can throw away the start of an SCP session and hang waiting for it

If an SCP server sends data (the initial zero byte of an SCP session) too
early, it can get processed by from_backend() before ssh_scp_recv() has started
and hence before outptr is set.  This causes the data to be discarded,
and PSCP to hang forever waiting for the handshake it's already received.
The obvious fix it to simply remove the check for (!outptr) in from_backend()
and depend on the correct handling of (outlen == 0), but this hasn't been
tested.
