<p>
We've had a couple of reports that recent versions of PuTTY have
trouble resolving hostnames, while other apps such as Windows Telnet,
and old versions of PuTTY, work fine. However, the only Win95 system I
(JTN) have access to appears to work fine in this regard; on that
system the Windows Sockets 2 upgrade is <em>not</em> installed,
whereas on at least one of the problem systems WinSock2 <em>does</em>
appear to be installed. (We changed to dynamically loading WinSock 2
where available in all applications between 0.53b and 0.54; previously
all the apps except Plink linked against WinSock 1.)

The error reported is "<tt>ssh_init: Host does not exist</tt>".
