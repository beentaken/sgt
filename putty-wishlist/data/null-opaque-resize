<p>
Opaque resizes under NT cause trouble when the user changes their
mind and carefully drags the window back to the way it started out:
the contents of the screen have been trashed and no resize event is
sent to the server. Perhaps redisplay during resizing should be
reimplemented in a way that doesn't change the terminal buffer's
size at all.
