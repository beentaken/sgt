Summary: Ability to bypass user authentication in SSH-2

<p>
In principle, it should be possible in SSH-2 to bypass the user
authentication stage entirely, and ask for the <tt>ssh-connection</tt>
service (which provides shells, port-forwarding and so on) directly,
rather than through the <tt>ssh-userauth</tt> service.

<p>
Currently, PuTTY is hardcoded to try <tt>ssh-userauth</tt>, and will
bomb out if that is not supported. It should be trivial to add an
option to try <tt>ssh-connection</tt> instead. (Perhaps we should also
try it if <tt>ssh-userauth</tt> is refused?)

<p>
We probably won't add this unless someone asks for it. (At least
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=K72Xd.57385%24EL5.23278%40trnddc05">one person</a>
has expressed an interest in using SSH purely for transport.)

<p>
(This isn't relevant to SSH-1, which doesn't have the modularity of
SSH-2.)
