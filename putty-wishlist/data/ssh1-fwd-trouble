<p>
We've had several reports of SSH-1 connections in PuTTY 0.58 bombing
out with various error messages when port- or X11 forwarding is in
use. The problems do not show up with SSH-2.

<p>
We haven't reproduced this ourselves yet. A correspondent has found
that the problem appeared between 2005-02-17 and 2005-02-18, which
implies that something between r5324:5335 broke it.

<p>
Error messages reported include:
<ul>
<li>"Incorrect CRC received on packet"
<li>"Extremely large packet length from server suggests data stream
corruption"
<li>"Out of memory"
</ul>

<p>
<em>Update:</em> we've made a change which is reported to have fixed
this. (It turns out that use of port forwarding wasn't absolutely
necessary to cause this problem.) Thanks to Gevan Dutton for pointing
us in the right direction.
