<p>
It's been suggested that PuTTY could usefully support xterm's 256-colour
mode (ESC [ 38;5;XX m and ESC [ 48;5;XX m, where XX is a colour
index from 0-255).

<p>
This would be a pretty easy piece of work, now that we have plenty
of free bits in the attribute word in the termchar structure.
However, I'm currently unaware of any applications that use it,
aside from a vague suggestion that people might put 256-colour codes
in their colour <code>ls</code> settings.

<p>
If anyone gives us a good reason why we should want to implement
this, I'll probably just go ahead and do it.

(&lt;1042233614.1153.15.camel@evilmagic.org&gt; contains a patch
to implement this, but it's very out of date.)
