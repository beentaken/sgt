Summary: Bug compatibility modes accidentally triggered for VShell.
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Difficulty: fun
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
It appears that the triggers for bug compatibility modes in
ssh_detect_bugs() are too lax. For instance, the following version
string (presented by
<a href="http://www.vandyke.com/products/vshell/">VShell</a>):

<blockquote><tt>SSH-2.0-2.0.1 (official) VShell</tt></blockquote>

<p>
is mistakenly triggering the HMAC bug compatibility mode.

<p>
A workaround in 0.53 is to manually turn off
detection of the bug (SSH / Bugs panel, "Miscomputes SSH2 HMAC
keys").

<p>
A better solution would be to use the wildcard engine we already
have for PS*P internally to match version strings. (This depends on
our being able to reconstruct exactly which version strings we should
be matching, of course!)
