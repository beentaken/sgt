Summary: Frontends need control over where do_paint() splits runs
Class: wish

<p>Currently, the way that <code>do_paint()</code> decides where to split the
text runs it passes to <code>do_text()</code> is rather <i>ad hoc</i> and
messy.  It splits whenever there is a change to the "attributes" of the
characters (subject to <code>term-&gt;attr_mask</code>), which includes
any changes to the high-order byte of the character codes.  It also splits
around characters in the U+23BA&ndash;U+23BD range because the Windows
front-end needs this.

<p>It seems to me (BJH) that we could do with some way for the front end
to inform the run-splitting code, so that <code>do_paint()</code> could
put in splits where the front end needs them, and not put in spurious splits
where it doesn't.  I don't yet have any clear idea how this should work,
though.
