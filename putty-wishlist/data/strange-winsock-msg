Summary: Strange WinSock messages cause failed assertion in tree234.c
Class: semi-bug
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.53 0.53b 2002-12-09 2003-01-07

<p>
A few people have reported seeing the following assertion failure:

<pre>Assertion failed!

Program: C:\Program Files\Putty\putty.exe
File: tree234.c
Line: 536

Expression: relation == REL234_LT || relation == REL234_GT</pre>

<p>
Appears to be dependent on use of port forwarding. Also, "It was
working fine until a few days ago", "funnily enough this started
happening in the last couple of weeks", so may be something to do with
a Windows hotfix or update.
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=auv6q1$ued$03$1%40news.t-online.com">One report</a>
indicates that it happens on WinXP but not Win2000; another report is
against WinME.

As far as we can tell this implies that WinSock is sending us unexpected
messages. As of 2002-12-09, diagnostics have been added of the form
"Strange WinSock message: wp=00000000 lp=00000002"; the numbers will
help us to debug the problem. Further info from an original reporter 
(<code>005801c2b80e$b6a3b470$1f69010a@jefflap3</code>):

<blockquote>
I have noticed that the lp=1 correlates to the rule
for port 3000 and lp=2 correlates to the rule for port 110.
