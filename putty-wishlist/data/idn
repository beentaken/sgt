Summary: Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)

Difficulty: tricky
Priority: low

<p>
We've had a couple of requests for IDN support
(<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3490.txt">RFC3490</a> et al)
in PuTTY.

Ideally this would be implemented by the OS. However it's been
suggested to us that Microsoft at least won't add anything "until at
least Longhorn". There are various libraries out there such as the
<a href="http://www.verisign.com/nds/naming/idn/sdk.html">VeriSign IDN SDK</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/">GNU libidn</a>.
