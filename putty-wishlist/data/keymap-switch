Summary: Switching Windows keymaps is ignored

There's been a report that if you switch Windows keymaps while PuTTY
is running, it doesn't notice: the keymap in force when PuTTY starts
up remains in force throughout.

This probably doesn't take much actual code to fix, but I don't know
what causes it or how to fix it, so someone else will have to help out.
