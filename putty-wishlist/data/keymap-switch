Summary: Switching Windows keymaps is ignored

There's been a report that if you switch Windows keymaps while PuTTY
is running, it doesn't notice: the keymap in force when PuTTY starts
up remains in force throughout.

This probably doesn't take much actual code to fix, but I don't know
what causes it or how to fix it, so someone else will have to help out.

OSD: I can't reproduce this on this Windows XP system, and the code
for recognising keymap switching (WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE) seems to have
been there since at least r1427 if not since RDB's Unicode patch in
r1110.  Unless anyone can reproduce this anywhere, I'm tempted to mark
it as done.
