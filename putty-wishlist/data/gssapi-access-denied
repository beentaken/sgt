Summary: Spurious "Access denied" printed in the PuTTY window after GSSAPI failure

<p>
PuTTY 0.61 attempts GSSAPI authentication by default, before asking
the user for any other kinds of authentication such as passwords or
key passphrases. If that authentication fails (which it does in the
very common case where GSSAPI is not set up) it prints "Access denied"
in the window, and then proceeds with other methods of authentication.
The "Access denied" message is ugly, and also confusing: it has
confused a few users into thinking that the entire authentication
phase had failed, instead of just one method.

<p>
As of r9232, this is fixed, and the logging of authentication messages
in both the PuTTY window and the Event Log has been generally cleaned
up so that a message about authentication failure is only printed if a
message had already been displayed indicating that that method was
even being tried.
