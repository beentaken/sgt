Summary: Framework for internationalisation
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Extract all the user-visible text to a single location, so it can be
easily replaced with a set of translations into other languages.
It's not yet clear whether we want to do this at compile time,
post-compile time, or using a Windows string resource (probably not
the latter since we will eventually be porting to non-Windows
environments).
