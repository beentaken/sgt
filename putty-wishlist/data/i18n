<p>
Extract all the user-visible text to a single location, so it can be
easily replaced with a set of translations into other languages.
It's not yet clear whether we want to do this at compile time,
post-compile time, or using a Windows string resource (probably not
the latter since we require portability to non-Windows environments;
for an example of a patch implementing this approach, see
<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA024651/#PuTTYkj_top">PuTTYkj</a>).

<p>
(Having special markup for strings &agrave; la
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">gettext</a>
may be useful in other ways; for instance, IIRC WinCE requires all UI
strings to be marked up as wide-character strings with
<code>L"foo"</code>. We could hide this behind the same markup we use
for l10n.)

<p>
In the meantime, people are welcome to create translated versions of
PuTTY, but these would have to be maintained as a fork of the PuTTY
code since there's no clean way to integrate them into the core code.
