It's certainly something I think we ought to have.  How would you 
suggest doing it?  The obvious approach is to log each line as it gets  
pushed into the scrollback, but this might get a bit awkward when the 
window gets enlarged (which pulls lines back _out_ of the scrollback).  
It also wouldn't log full-screen applications that don't scroll the 
screen, but I'm not sure you'd want to.
