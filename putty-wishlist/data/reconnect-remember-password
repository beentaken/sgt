Summary: Remember entered password for reconnecting a dead session

<p>
Some people would like for PuTTY to remember any password entered, 
and submit it without the user's intervention in the event of an
unclean disconnect (often in conjunction with
<a href="reconnect-auto.html">automatically reconnecting</a>) so
they don't have to type it again.

<p>
I don't think we'll be implementing this, for much the same reasons
we won't implement <a href="remember-password.html">storing the password
in saved settings</a>.
