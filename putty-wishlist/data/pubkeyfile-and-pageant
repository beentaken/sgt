Summary: Pageant + explicit keyfile gives non-optimal behaviour

<p>
When Pageant is running and a keypair is explicitly specified (via
<code>-i</code>, configuration or whatever), PuTTY will try authenticating
with all the keys in Pageant regardless. This isn't ideal for various
reasons.

<p>
This is particularly obvious when several keys are valid for a given
connection (e.g., if one is trying to use a particular key to run
a particular forced command).  It can also cause problems if Pageant
has lots of keys and the server (e.g. OpenSSH) is configured to only
allow a certain number of authentication attempts.  See the
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/puttydoc/Chapter10.html#errors-toomanyauth">errors chapter</a>
of the PuTTY manual.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-11-14:</em> If Pageant is running and a keyfile is
specified, PuTTY will now only try Pageant authentication with that
key; it will ignore any other keys Pageant may have.
