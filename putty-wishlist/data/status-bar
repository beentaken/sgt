<p>
The PuTTY window could have a status bar with various information on
it. A visible indicator of whether the connection is secured or not
(for the paranoids who aren't sure whether they remembered to hit
the SSH radio button); a display of the cursor coordinates; whether
the terminal bell is currently overloaded; some sort of visual
representation of the host key perhaps. Anything else that springs
to mind.

<p>
This would certainly be a configurable feature, if we do it at all.
PuTTY's minimalist use of screen space is valuable to a number of
its users. But other people might find it useful.
