Summary: Use of MS Crypto API on Windows

<p>
We did once have 
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon-anonsvn/viewcvs.cgi/putty/mscrypto.c?rev=1308">some
sort of
optional support</a> for the Microsoft Crypto API, but it rotted, and
didn't support all the algorithms we needed (eg Blowfish), so was
eventually removed.

<p>
Quoth Simon:
<blockquote>
My other concern about CryptoAPI is the whole idea of handing a
MS-controlled function a pointer and saying `here, take a look at my
plaintext'. Not that I think MS is likely to be bugging that
function (as it were) at the moment, but there's no point in making
it <em>easy</em> for someone to install a modified DLL and trojan all
cryptography done in the system.

<p>
On the other hand, it might be good to be able to make use of the
thermal noise-based random number generators now appearing in some
commodity chipsets such as the 
<a href="http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/290658.htm?iid=ipp_810chpst+info_ds_fwh&">Intel 810 FWH</a>.
These might be exposed through the Crypto API.

<p>
May also be relevant to <a href="smartcard-auth.html">`smartcard-auth'</a>.

<p>
Any support would have to be optional (controlled by configuration
option? Test for presence of API?). Probably an application for the
<a href="mdpi.html">MDPI</a>.
