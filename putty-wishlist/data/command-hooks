<p>
We occasionally get asked for the ability to run external commands at
various points in PuTTY's operation. One particularly common request
is for some way to invoke a command after authentication has completed
and port forwarding has been set up, to start an application that's
dependent on the forwarding being in place.

<p>
Possibly an application for <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a>,
although many common cases wouldn't need that level of flexibility.
