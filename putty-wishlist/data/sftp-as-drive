It's sometimes suggested that PSFTP would be more useful if it could present
an SFTP connection as a mapped drive in Windows.  This would be useful, but
it would also be a lot of effort, would involve lots of nasty windows-specific
low-level code, and would be quite a long way from PuTTY's core mission of
terminal emulation.
