Summary: Short RSA2 key causes PuTTY crash
Class: bug
Present-in: 0.53b 2003-11-03

"If I create a really short RSA2 key (I used 256 bits) it is generated and
accepted OK, but the PuTTY code (CVS head, 22:00 GMT yesterday) segfaults."

More detail: <20031101102009.GA29907@chiark.greenend.org.uk>
(includes suspected root cause)

(I've tested that DSA and RSA1 keys don't suffer from the same problem.)
