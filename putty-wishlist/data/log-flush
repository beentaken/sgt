Summary: Flush session log file during session

Perhaps we should occasionally flush the session log during a session
`printable output only' and `all session output' logging modes, so
that the file on disc is at least vaguely up-to-date.

This is done as of 2004-08-13. It incurs some performance overhead, of
course; if anyone complains, we could make it less frequent, or optional.
