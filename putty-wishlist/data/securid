<p>
Several people have asked for support for the implementation of
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/node.asp?id=1156">SecurID</a>
in ssh.com's server.

<p>
While older versions of ssh.com's server used a private authentication
method `securid-1@ssh.com', it appears that more recent versions use
`keyboard-interactive', for which PuTTY <em>does</em> have support.

<p>
We haven't seen a spec for the private method, so can't implement it
in PuTTY, though there's <a href="http://sweb.cz/v_t_m/">a patch to
support it in OpenSSH 3.7.1p2</a>.

<p>
(There appears to be
<a href="http://www.cswl.com/whiteppr/white/ssh.html">another spec</a>
for a custom method `secure-id', although I don't believe it's ever
been discussed by the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/secsh-charter.html">SSH working group</a>
or presented as an Internet-Draft, so that method name syntax is
inappropriate. I'm not aware of any servers that implement it,
either.)
