<p>
Several people have asked for support for the implementation of
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/products/securid/index.html">SecurID</a>
in ssh.com's server.

<p>
While older versions of ssh.com's server used a private authentication
method `securid-1@ssh.com', it appears that more recent versions use
`keyboard-interactive', for which PuTTY <em>does</em> have support.

<p>
We haven't seen a spec for the private method, so can't implement it
in PuTTY.
