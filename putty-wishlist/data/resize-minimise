<p>Another bit of resize flakiness that's been reported :
<ul>
<li>Open a connection somewhere.
<li>Resize the window (to verify that it can be resized).
<li>Type alt-space, then 'n' to minimize the window.
<li>Alt-tab (or click it on the taskbar) to bring it back up.
<li>Attempt to resize the window. There'll be a lot of flickering, and
if you chose a left/top handle the window will move around, but it
won't resize.
<li>Type something into the window.
<li>Resizing now works.
</ul>

<p>(This may be something to look at when fixing the other
<a href="resize.html">resize flakiness</a>.)

<p><em>Update:</em> This bug appears to have mysteriously fixed itself
sometime between 2002-10-24 and 2002-10-29. During this period there
was a lot of global-removal and Unix-porting upheaval, including some
bug fixes, so I'm going to claim this is fixed.
