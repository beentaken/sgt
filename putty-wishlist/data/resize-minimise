<p>Another bit of resize flakiness that's been reported :
<ul>
<li>Open a connection somewhere.
<li>Resize the window (to verify that it can be resized).
<li>Type alt-space, then 'n' to minimize the window.
<li>Alt-tab (or click it on the taskbar) to bring it back up.
<li>Attempt to resize the window. There'll be a lot of flickering, and
if you chose a left/top handle the window will move around, but it
won't resize.
<li>Type something into the window.
<li>Resizing now works.
</ul>

<p>(This may be something to look at when fixing the other
