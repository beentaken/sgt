Summary: Avoid using message boxes for "connection closed" and friends

<p>
Perhaps, for people who don't like dialog boxes, messages like
"connection closed" and fatal errors should be configurable to
appear inside the window instead of popping up sudden message boxes.

<p>
If we do this, we should probably include a means of distinguishing
that sort of error output from <em>anything</em> the remote site can
possibly send. This is potentially a hard problem, so it requires
some design work.
