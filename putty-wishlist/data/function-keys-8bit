Summary: Option to start key sequences with 0x9B instead of 0x1B
Class: wish
Difficulty: fun
Priority: low
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Debian apparently has a terminal type <code>xterm-8bit</code> where
all occurrences of 0x1B in key sequences (such as function keys) are
replaced by 0x9B.

<p>
This gets rid of the irritating delay on pressing Esc while the server
works out of it's part of a multi-byte sequence or not.

<p>
It's been suggested that PuTTY should have an option to work like
this.
