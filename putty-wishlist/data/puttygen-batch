Summary: Batch mode for Windows PuTTYgen

<p>
We're occasionally asked for a means of generating keys
non-interactively with the Windows version of PuTTYgen; for instance,
command-line arguments to specify the key type and so on.

<p>
The main reason that we haven't done this is that interaction would
still be required; there isn't a source of sufficiently good
randomness on Windows, so for key generation we make the user generate
some by waving the mouse around.

<p>
Another reason that the current Windows PuTTYgen is unsuited to batch
use is that as a Windows GUI application, it will not block the batch
file but be launched off asynchronously. Even ignoring the randomness
issue (which can be ignored for automated format conversions, for
instance), a separate console application would be required.

<p>
(The Unix version of PuTTYgen can and does run in a batch mode, as we
use <tt>/dev/random</tt> there, which is assumed to be a sufficiently
good source of randomness and doesn't require us to interact with the
user.)
