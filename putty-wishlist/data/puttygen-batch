Summary: Batch mode for Windows PuTTYgen

<p>
We're occasionally asked for a means of generating keys
non-interactively with the Windows version of PuTTYgen; for instance,
command-line arguments to specify the key type and so on.

<p>
The main reason that we haven't done this is that interaction would
still be required; there isn't a source of sufficiently good
randomness on Windows, so for key generation we make the user generate
some by waving the mouse around.

<p>
Also, since Windows PuTTYgen is a GUI application, even ignoring the
randomness issue (which can be ignored for automated format
conversions, for instance), using it from a batch file is slightly
tricky. Normally, it will not block the batch file, but this could be
dealt with with <tt>START /WAIT</tt>.

<p>
However, it's still not clear how such a setup might e.g. indicate
errors (given that it probably won't be able to interact with the
console). Since we already <em>have</em> a command-line PuTTYgen (for
Unix), it might be better to just port that to Windows as a console
application, disabling key generation on the way.

<p>
(The Unix version of PuTTYgen can and does run in a batch mode, as we
use <tt>/dev/random</tt> there, which is assumed to be a sufficiently
good source of randomness and doesn't require us to interact with the
user.)
