<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-harris-ssh-rsa-kex-06.txt">draft-harris-ssh-rsa-kex</a>
(in the <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/queue.html">RFC Editor's queue</a>
at the time of writing) defines a means to use RSA key exchange in
SSH-2 (similar to SSH-1's key exchange, but without the other
disadvantages of SSH-1). This might be particularly suitable for slow
client systems.
