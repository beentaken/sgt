<p>
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4432.txt">RFC 4432</a>
(formerly draft-harris-ssh-rsa-kex) defines a means to use RSA key
exchange in SSH-2 (similar to SSH-1's key exchange, but without the
other disadvantages of SSH-1). This might be particularly suitable for
slow client systems.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2012-06-22</b>: Perhaps this is as good a place as any to keep
a list of known server-side implementations.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314">OpenSSH bug #1314</a>
includes a patch which adds RSA key exchange to OpenSSH, although the
OpenSSH maintainers decided not to integrate it in the end.
<li>
<a href="ftp://sparkle.rodents-montreal.org/pub/mouse/local/src/moussh">MouSSH</a>
supports RSA key exchange. (It looks as if the FTP link here is the
most convenient way to get MouSSH: you'll need the contents of that
directory and several libraries in directories alongside it &#8211;
see the <code>INSTALL</code> file for a list &#8211; and I haven't
personally confirmed that it compiles and works.)
<li>
The
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_sftp.html"><code>mod_sftp</code></a>
module for
<a href="http://www.proftpd.org/">ProFTPD</a>
is documented as supporting RSA key exchange. (But it looks as if you
can't do anything except SFTP over the resulting connection.)
</ul>
