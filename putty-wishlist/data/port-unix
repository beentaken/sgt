Summary: Port to Unix

<p>
It's currently being worked on. If you look at the nightly source
snapshots, you should find a <code>unix</code> subdirectory, which should
build you a Unix port of Plink, and also <code>pterm</code> - an
<code>xterm</code>-type program which supports the same terminal emulation
as PuTTY.

<p>
You can also build a Unix port of PuTTY itself. This isn't as useful a
thing on Unix as it is on Windows; its major value is as a pathfinding
effort for other ports. If anyone really has a use for it, we'd be
interested to know why :-)

<p>
Ports of <code>psftp</code>, <code>pscp</code>, and <code>puttygen</code>
are also now available.

<p>
We do not yet have a Unix port of Pageant (although another agent can be
used).

<em>Update:</em> as of 0.54, we think this is good enough to release.
