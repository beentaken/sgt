Summary: Port to Unix

<p>
It's currently being worked on. If you look at the nightly source
snapshots, you should find a <code>unix</code> subdirectory, which should
build you a Unix port of Plink, and also <code>pterm</code> - an
<code>xterm</code>-type program which supports the same terminal emulation
as PuTTY.

<p>
It isn't yet clear whether we will bother combining the terminal
emulator and network back end into the same process, to provide a
Unix port of the full GUI form of PuTTY. It wouldn't be as useful a
thing on Unix as it would be on Windows; its major value would
probably be as a pathfinding effort for other ports. If anyone
really wants it, we'd be interested to know why :-)
