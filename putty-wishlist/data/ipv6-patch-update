<p>
We have integrated IPv6-related patches from
<a href="http://unfix.org/projects/ipv6/">unfix.org</a> up to their
patch level 4.

<p>
However, they are now up to patch level 10 (at the time of writing).
Should we integrate their further tweaks at some point?

<p>
<b>SGT, 2004-12-30</b>: I have integrated unfix.org's latest patch
(v10). It took some polishing, but it's done. Also it's enabled in
the nightly builds.
