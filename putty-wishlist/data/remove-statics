<p>
For several reasons it would be handy to be able to run multiple
connections in a single process. This will require removing most (or
all) of PuTTY's static and global variables, and replacing them with
fields in dynamically allocated structures.

<p>
This is a code cleanup which we should probably do anyway.

<b>SGT, 2003-01-14</b>: After much pain and upheaval, I think this
is now as done as it'll ever be. The Unicode module was particularly
unpleasant (and wants a substantial rewrite really), and there are a
few remaining globals which are genuinely global (applying to all
sessions) so I've left them in; but I think everything pertaining to
a particular session is now non-global, at least in the portable
parts of the code. (The Windows front end still has many static
variables, but they will probably never go away.)
