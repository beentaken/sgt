<p>
SRP support in SSH, as an alternative to pure password authentication.
Possibly also in Telnet.

<p>
This would be <em>really</em> useful in SSH, because it removes a
lot of the danger of accepting a host key you're uncertain about.
The SRP exchange convinces each side that the other side knows the
same password, without requiring either side to give the password
away to the other - so if you use SRP authentication, you can safely
type your password in even if you don't know the remote host key is
correct. Moreover, the current drafts of SRP authentication in SSH
then use the SRP shared secret to authenticate the SSH host key - so
that even if you aren't sure the host key belongs to the host you
think it does, you can at least be sure that it does belong to a
machine which knows your password. This would be a massive
improvement in the SSH host key model.
