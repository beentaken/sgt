<p>
The taskbar bell indication needs cleaning up. It works nicely on
Win95/NT4 but is quite ugly on more recent versions of Windows such as
Win2K.

<p>
We should use <tt>FlashWindowEx()</tt> if it's available at run-time
(this just needs calling once, and will flash the window as
necessary), and fall back to the current <tt>FlashWindow()</tt> manual
flashing implementation if not.

<p>
Where <tt>FlashWindowEx()</tt> is available, `steady' mode flashes the
window the conventional number of times and then leaves the taskbar
entry highlighted.
