Summary: PSFTP, and PSCP in SFTP mode, transfer files much slower than old-PSCP.

<p>
We believe this is because the SFTP and SSH2 protocols are less efficient at
bulk data transfer than SCP and SSH1, because every block of data transferred
requires an acknowledgment from the far end. It would in theory be possible to
queue several blocks of data to get round this speed problem, but as yet we
haven't done the coding.

<em>Update:</em> As of the 2003-09-30 snapshot, performance should be
much improved. I believe there are tweaks that could be done to make
it better still, but I'm going to declare this closed anyway.
