Summary: PSFTP transfers files much slower than PSCP.
Difficulty: taxing

<p>
We believe this is because the SFTP and SSH2 protocols are less efficient at
bulk data transfer than SCP and SSH1, because every block of data transferred
requires an acknowledgment from the far end. It would in theory be possible to
queue several blocks of data to get round this speed problem, but as yet we
haven't done the coding. If you really want this fixed, feel free to offer to
help.
