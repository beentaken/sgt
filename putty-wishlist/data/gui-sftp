Summary: A GUI client for SFTP
Class: wish
Priority: low
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
A GUI SFTP client. (Possibly it should also be able to use SCP but
with massively reduced functionality.) Writing big complex GUIs is
hard work and I simply don't have the effort to spare.

Some third-party file transfer clients using PuTTY code can be
found on our <a href="../links.html">Links page</a>.
