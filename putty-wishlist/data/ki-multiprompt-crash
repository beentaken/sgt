<p>
In an SSH-2 session, if PuTTY is presented with a single
`keyboard-interactive' packet containing multiple prompts, it will
crash after the first prompt. This only affects PuTTY proper; the
non-GUI tools (PSCP, PSFTP, Plink) should work fine.

<p>
This problem has the same root cause as
<a href="ssh1-bad-passphrase-crash.html">`ssh1-bad-passphrase-crash'</a>,
and should be fixed by the same rearrangement.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-10-31:</em> I believe this should now be fixed,
and we've had one report confirming that.
