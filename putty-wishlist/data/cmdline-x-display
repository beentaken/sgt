<p>PuTTY should probably have a command-line option to set the local X display,
so that people who run PuTTY on multi-user machines can get the right one.
Of course, if there's some better way to find the user's X display in Windows,
we should support that too.

<p><a href="cmdline-any-option.html">cmdline-any-option</a> might make this
unnecessary.

<p><em>Update 2004-10</em>: if the "X display" is left blank in the
configuration, PuTTY will attempt to take the display location from the
environment variable <code>DISPLAY</code> (on both Windows and Unix).
