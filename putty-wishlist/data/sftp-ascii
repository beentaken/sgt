Summary: ASCII mode for SFTP
Class: wish
Priority: medium
Difficulty: tricky

Until recently, the SCP and SFTP protocols had no notion of
transferring a file in anything other than binary mode. (This is still
true of SCP.)

The current draft protocol spec of SFTP proposes a means of
implementing ASCII transfer. At some point PSCP/PSFTP may implement
this proposal.
