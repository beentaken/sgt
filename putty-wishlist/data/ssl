There's been one request for SSL. (SSL/Telnet in particular;
possibly also raw-SSL in order to talk directly to HTTPS?) Most of
the SSL protocol looks reasonably sane, except for the certificates
(ASN.1 and X509 and other buzzwords). If the certificate processing
turns out to take <em>too</em> much code, SSL might not make it into
the PuTTY core for size reasons - it would have to be compiled in
specially, or perhaps shipped as a separate DLL.
