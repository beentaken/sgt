<p>
Possibly line-end conversion in PSCP and PSFTP. An option to turn it
on, an option (enabled by default) to turn it off, and perhaps an
option to try to auto-detect whether to turn it on or not. (Anyone
know a good heuristic for distinguishing text from binary files?
infozip has one, as does less; anyone want to comment on which is
better or whether there are better still?)

<p>
Of course, it would be good to have protocol support rather than
having to rely on heuristics, but the last discussion on IETF SECSH
about adding this to SFTP didn't come to any consensus.
