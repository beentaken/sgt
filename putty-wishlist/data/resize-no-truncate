<p>
It might be nice if reducing the width of a terminal window, then
restoring it, didn't gratuitously lose information from the
right-hand ends of lines. (Like NiftyTelnet-SSH on the Mac.)

<p>
This should be relatively easy (it's already the case for the
scrollback).

<p>
(cf. <a href="resize-scroll-effects.html">`resize-scroll-effects'</a>
for the case where the number of rows is changed.)
