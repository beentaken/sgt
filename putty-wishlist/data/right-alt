Summary: Support for Right Alt on keyboards which don't call it AltGr

<p>
Most PC keyboards use the key to the right of the space bar as AltGr,
an extra shift key for generating interesting graphic characters,
but some keyboard layouts (apparently the US one, at least) don't, and users
of such layouts might like to have an option that makes it work the
same way as the left Alt key.

<p>
This would be easy to implement by means of a configuration option,
but it would be nicer if we could somehow detect this property of
the active keymap and automatically switch between that key being
Right Alt and being AltGr.

We might be able to make a guess by comparing the result of
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/UserInput/KeyboardInput/KeyboardInputReference/KeyboardInputFunctions/GetKeyboardLayout.asp">GetKeyboardLayout()</a>
to known values from the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_238z.asp">table of language identifiers</a>,
but this is flaky enough that it'd want to be a On/Off/Auto
option and may not be worth the effort.
