<p>
We've had some reports that PuTTY utterly fails to run on at least
some versions of Windows XP, with the following error message:

<p>
<blockquote>
The application has failed to start because the
application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the
application may fix this problem.
</blockquote>

<p>
I believe this is likely due to a trim I (JTN) made to the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sbscs/setup/application_manifests.asp">application manifests</a>;
we tested it on one XP install but it seems not all XP installs are
born equal, although we're not sure what the discriminating factor is
yet.

<p>
If so, it will affect the graphical utilities only (PuTTY, PuTTYtel,
PuTTYgen, and Pageant).
