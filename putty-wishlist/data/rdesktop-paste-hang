<p>
We've had a few reports that the following scenario causes PuTTY to hang
("Not responding"):
<ol>
<li>Set up a PuTTY session with a tunnel for a Remote Desktop session.
<li>Copy text from the Remote Desktop session.
<li>Paste it into the PuTTY session running the tunnel.
</ol>
Closing the Remote Desktop session apparently unwedges PuTTY.

<p>
This sounds like a classic deadlock. However, we haven't been able to
reproduce it ourselves (with XP SP1). There's some indication that it
only happens when pasting from certain applications on the Remote
Desktop end (<a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a> is one such),
which could explain that.

<p>
A workaround is apparently to paste into some other application before
pasting into PuTTY.
