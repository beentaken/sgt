Summary: Server-controlled clearing of the scrollback

<p>
It would sometimes be nice to be able to clear PuTTY's scrollback from
the server (via an escape sequence). Example applications:
<ul>
<li>Terminal locking software (e.g. <tt>screen</tt>'s C-a C-x) could
issue this escape sequence.</li>
<li>If a lot of output is generated it makes use of the scrollback as
a poor man's <tt>less</tt> easier.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>xterm</code> uses an extension to ED to do this, in the form of
CSI <code>3</code> <code>J</code>.  We could do the same.
<ul>
<li>For avoidance of doubt, this sequence <em>only</em> clears the
scrollback in xterm - it doesn't have any other effect. (xterm "XFree86
4.1.0(165)" in Debian xterm_4.1.0-16woody1)
</ul>

<p>
It's been suggested that screen clears could do this. If so, it would
have to be configurable, and disabled by default.
