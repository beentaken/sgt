<p>Opening a forwarded X11 connection over an SSH connection that's using a
proxy fails to work. (Versions of PuTTY before 2002-10-11 may also crash.)

<p>I (JTN) can reproduce this with HTTP proxying.

<p>Appears to be occur regardless of whether there's an X server to connect to.
When I do have an X server running, it doesn't appear to see any traffic
when attempting X forwarding through a proxy.

<p>
Symptom is something like the following:
<p><pre>X connection to chiark:27.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown)</pre>

<p>PuTTY behaves as though the X connection is being opened then slammed shut:
<p><pre>2002-10-17 18:07:24     Received X11 connect request
2002-10-17 18:07:24     opening X11 forward connection succeeded
2002-10-17 18:07:24     Opened X11 forward channel
2002-10-17 18:07:24     Forwarded X11 connection terminated</pre>

<p>
A workaround is to add `localhost,127.0.0.1' to the proxy exclusions.
This implies that our proxying code is being over-enthusiastic and needs
reining in.
