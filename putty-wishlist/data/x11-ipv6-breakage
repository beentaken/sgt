<p>
We've had one report that X forwarding in PuTTY broke after we
integrated the IPv6 code. Presumably the IPv6 changes have had some
sort of side effect on the local network connection between PuTTY
and the X server, but it isn't clear what since we haven't been able
to reproduce it.

<p>
We received this report by email
(<code>&lt;41E6F012.2040105@ressukka.net&gt;</code>). Details
include:

<ul>
<li>
The symptom at the remote end is that X applications report "X
connection to localhost:10.0 broken (explicit kill or server
shutdown)".
<li>
The X display in the PuTTY configuration is the PuTTY default
(equivalent to <code>localhost:0</code>). The reporter found that
requesting <code>127.0.0.1:0</code> instead worked, although not
consistently. (This leads me to wonder whether
"<code>localhost</code>" might have been resolving to an IPv6
address on the system in question.)
<li>
The X server was xorg 6.8.1 from Cygwin.
<li>
Windows version was XP SP2.
</ul>

<p>
If anyone is able to reproduce this or shed some light on possible
causes, we'd be grateful.
