Summary: Support for IP address ranges (x.x.x.x/y) in proxy exclude list

<p>
Our proxy exclude list accepts filename-style wildcards
(192.168.33.* and similar) on IP addresses, because I had the
wildcard matching engine to spare anyway (having just used it for
hostnames).

<p>
Of course I completely forgot that there's already a
well-established way to specify ranges of IP addresses, that being
the number-of-leading-bits notation (192.168.33.0/24). Same thing
applies in IPv6.

<p>
The proxy exclude list clearly ought to support this notation. It's
standard, it doesn't clash with any existing behaviour, and it's not
too hard to do. No reason at all why not.
