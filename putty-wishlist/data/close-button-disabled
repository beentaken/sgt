<p>
We've had a couple of reports that the `Close' button (the `X' on the
top right of the window) is disabled on PuTTY windows, as is the
corresponding window/context menu entry.

<p>
Reports indicate that the close button is greyed sometime during
authentication.

<p>
All the reports so far have been on Windows XP, which none of the team
use on a regular basis.
