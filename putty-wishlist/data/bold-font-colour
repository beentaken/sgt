Summary: Ability to change font *and* change colour for bold text

<p>PuTTY allows bold text to be displayed by either emboldening the
font, or by changing the colour of the text.

<p>xterm allows these two options to be configured independently, so
you can have both at once if you want it. Some users have highly
xterm-specific application configurations which depend on this to
look sensible.

<p>It would be trivially easy to replace PuTTY's single checkbox with a
pair of checkboxes, allowing bold-as-colour and bold-as-font to be
selected in any combination. If we do that then we should probably
warn the user if they disable both at once, though it's not clear
what form that warning should take (a message box is probably
overkill for what's basically a cosmetic issue).

<p>Debian bug <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/167785">167785</a> would
appear to be an instance of this problem.
