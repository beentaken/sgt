<p>
We occasionally get requests to make PuTTY usable as a front-end to
the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
terminal multiplexer, providing out-of-band control so that key
sequences like C-a are freed up for use.

<p>
While this is clearly desirable, we want to avoid encoding knowledge
of server-side applications into the core of PuTTY. This is a clear
application of <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a> and is unlikely
to happen before that is implemented.
