Summary: Occasional `Access denied' / `RSA_verify failed'

<p>
With SSH2, OpenSSH (various versions), RSA public key, key
authentication has been reported to occasionally and randomly fail
with an `Access denied' message. A message like the following is
written in the server's log:

<pre>error: ssh_rsa_verify: RSA_verify failed:
    error:04077077:lib(4):func(119):reason(119)</pre>

<p>
which apparently resolves to "the <tt>RSA_verify()</tt> function in
SSL telling [us] <tt>RSA_R_WRONG_SIGNATURE_LENGTH</tt>".

<b>SGT, 2002-05-30</b>:
This is in fact not a complex bignum bug in PuTTY, but is a simple
disagreement between PuTTY and OpenSSH about the correct way to pad
RSA signatures in SSH2. It appears that the draft RFC is on our
side, so this is a bug in OpenSSH, apparently caused by their
RSA-for-SSH2 implementation being done before the specification was
finalised. They will hopefully fix it for OpenSSH 3.3. However,
PuTTY should detect OpenSSH versions which have the bug and pad its
signatures appropriately for those versions; hence I've reclassified
this as a nice easy feature addition rather than a hard bug.
