Summary: Option to leave DNS lookup to proxies

<p>When connecting through a proxy, there should be an option to
leave looking up the hostname to the proxy, to cope with setups
where the client's and proxy's views of the DNS are different
(search paths, client has no DNS configured, etc).

<p>It should be optional; I can imagine wanting to perform the
lookup locally (for similar reasons).
