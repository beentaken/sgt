<p>
As a side-effect of <a href="ipv6.html">IPv6 support</a>, on modern
versions of Windows, the hostname displayed in the title bar has
changed - it is now the result of a forward and reverse lookup,
whereas before it was whatever the OS regarded as a "canonical name"
(usually the input hostname resolution of CNAMEs/search paths).

<p>
This seems overenthusiastic, and bugs some people, so it's been
reverted to the previous behaviour.

<p>
The title bar is the main use of the canonical name, so this is
largely a cosmetic change. (It may also be used for some other things
such as proxy exclusions.)
