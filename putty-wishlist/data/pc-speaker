Summary: Beep using the PC speaker

Among the many bell options we already support, it would be nice to
support the built-in PC speaker. Unfortunately this seems to be
non-trivial: on Win95-series systems this can apparently be done
using MessageBeep(0xFFFFFFFF), but on NT-series systems this doesn't
do anything different from MessageBeep(MB_OK) and there's some other
system call that will do it. So we'd need to auto-detect which kind
of system we were running on.
