<p>
When the terminal is in "mouse reporting" mode, and Shift is used to
override this for clipboard operations, text is not reliably copied to
the clipboard.

<p>
In particular, if the Shift key is released before the mouse button being
used for selection is released, the copy operation does not happen --
the mouse release event is reported to the server instead.
