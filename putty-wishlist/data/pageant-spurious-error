Summary: Spurious pageant error message with -i switch
Content-type: text/plain
Class: bug
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.53 2002-10-07

pageant can be invoked as pageant -i <private key file> to have it 
automatically load a key on start up. When this is done, a message box with 
the text "Couldn't load this key (unable to open file)" appears. When this 
message box is dismissed, a dialog prompts for the passphrase for the key. 
Pageant then starts normally with the specified key loaded.

Expected behavior:
Since there seems to be no problem loading the key, there should be no 
error message.
