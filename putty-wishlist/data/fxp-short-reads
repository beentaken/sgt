Summary: Support short reads in SFTP
Class: semi-bug
Difficulty: tricky
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
In the SSH file transfer protocol (SFTP), there is the possibility of
the server returning less data than we asked for in response to a read
request (SSH_FXP_READ).

<p>
Currently, the SFTP implementation in PSFTP/PSCP will barf if this
happens other than at EOF ("error while reading: received a short
buffer from FXP_READ, but not at EOF"). The filexfer draft at the time
seemed to indicate that this was an exceptional condition that only
applied to "special" files. However, on closer examination, its
"guarantee" of no short reads appears not to be reliable.

<p>
We've had one report of this causing trouble with an OpenVMS server
that likes to return ZIP files in 512-byte chunks due to the nature of
the underlying filesystem (whereas we ask for 4k chunks).

<p>
Since PSFTP/PSCP usually
<a href="sftp-slow.html">have several requests outstanding</a>
at any one time, dealing with this properly requires a strategy for
dealing with fragmentation and reassembly. (But this shouldn't be too
bad as we already deal with out-of-order responses.) We may also want to
attempt to adapt to the server's apparent preferred block size,
although we should be prepared for this adaptation to fail.

<p>
All this should probably be implemented in as paranoid a manner as
possible to avoid the server being able to cause unbounded buffering
at our end.
