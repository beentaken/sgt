<p>
It appears that the SSH-2 server in some versions of Cisco CatOS (version
string "SSH-2.0-Cisco-1.25") is unable to cope with the
<a href="http://svn.tartarus.org/?view=rev&amp;rev=5122">additional padding</a>
that PuTTY puts on packets containing passwords in order to mask their length.
This additional padding is permitted by the SSH-2 specification, which
merely requires:

<pre>
      random padding
         Arbitrary-length padding, such that the total length of
         (packet_length || padding_length || payload || random padding)
         is a multiple of the cipher block size or 8, whichever is
         larger.  There MUST be at least four bytes of padding.  The
         padding SHOULD consist of random bytes.  The maximum amount of
         padding is 255 bytes.
</pre>

<p>This can be solved by reverting to sending an SSH_MSG_IGNORE immediately
after the password, either for all connections or just when talking to
broken Cisco servers.  Alternatively, we could just accept guessable password
lengths when talking to broken servers.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2007-01-07</b>: I've now reverted to the IGNORE message
universally, which should fix it.
