<p>
There is a port to the Mac OS in progress.  It's just about usable, but has
an awful lot of gaps and rough edges that will need cleaning up before
release.  See <a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon-anonsvn/viewcvs.cgi/putty/mac/README.mac?view=markup">
README.mac</a> in the sources for the current state of the world.
