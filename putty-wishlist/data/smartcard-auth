<p>It's been suggested that PuTTY could use RSA keys held on a smartcard for
authentication.  This would require interfacing with smartcard APIs and
suchlike, and might be an application for the <a href="mdpi.html">MDPI</a>.

<p>Alternatively, it might be better to integrate smartcard support into
an SSH agent, either as part of Pageant or as a plug-in replacement for it.
After all, the purpose of a smartcard is to generate cryptographic signatures
on demand, which is what an SSH agent does too.
