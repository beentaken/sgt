<p>
Support for proxies. There are several types of proxy to consider:
<ul>
<li>
SOCKS.
<li>
HTTP CONNECT style proxying (connect to the HTTP port and send
something like "<code>CONNECT hostname.example.com:22
HTTP/1.0</code>", then parse the HTTP return headers and go)
<li>
Simple by-hand proxy: the kind where you telnet to the firewall and
type "<code>connect hostname.example.com 22</code>", and then expect
a connection to begin.
</ul>
We would also want the ability to define non-proxy zones (probably
give the user the choice of DNS or IP address space).

<p>
This has all been implemented in 0.53.
