Summary: Reports of PSFTP hanging/consuming 100% CPU
Absent-in: 0.56
Present-in: 0.58 2005-08-11

We've had several reports of PSFTP 0.58 hanging or consuming lots
of CPU. Possibly this only happens when it's started from Explorer,
rather than the Command Prompt.

I wasn't able to reproduce this on Win98; however, on Win2K SP4,
a PSFTP instance started from a shortcut (including from the start menu)
seems to just sit there and munch CPU when asked to "open <sessname>",
whereas the same binary started from cmd.exe works fine. No output is
seen even if the shortcut invokes "psftp -v". (Seen with 0.58 and
2005-08-11:r6183.)
