<p>
People occasionally ask for PuTTY to interpret escape codes in the
banner some SSH servers send prior to authentication.

<p>
The current SSH-2 authentication draft
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-userauth-17.txt">draft-ietf-secsh-userauth-17</a>
states, in the section about <code>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_BANNER</code>:

<blockquote>
      If the message string is displayed, control character filtering
      discussed in [SSH-ARCH] SHOULD be used to avoid attacks by sending
      terminal control characters.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is what PuTTY does, and as such, terminal-control sequences won't
work.
