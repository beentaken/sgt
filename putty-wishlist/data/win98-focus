Summary: Win98 focuses taskbar after PuTTY window closed

On Win98, closing a PuTTY window returns focus to the taskbar rather
than to the second-most recently focused window.  This could well be
related to window-placement and PuTTY's guess window.

The problem doesn't seem to occur on Win2K and NT.
