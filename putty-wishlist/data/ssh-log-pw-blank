Summary: Blank known passwords by default in SSH packet log
Class: wish

<p>
Proposal for the SSH packet log we use for debugging: add a checkbox
(enabled by default) which causes known password fields to be blanked
out, as we recommend that people do manually at the moment.

<p>
95% of the time this information isn't useful for our diagnosis, and
blanking it out manually is error-prone (it's not unknown for someone
to blank out the text portion but forget the hex dump, for example).
If we suspect that the information will be useful, we can always
instruct our correspondent to uncheck the box.

<p>
This would also mean that people could turn logging on
semi-permanently for intermittent problems and not have to be so
careful with the log files.

<p>
Need to correctly handle things like keyboard-interactive
authentication, of course.

<p>
A similar option (but not enabled by default) would be to blank the
data (`payload') fields - again, this information isn't often useful,
and it would reduce the care that has to be taken with log files.

<p>
Obviously this isn't completely secure - even a blanked-out log file
contains a fair amount of information that's useful to an attacker.
But it's probably a net improvement.

<p>
As of Sep 2002, I (JTN) had a 90% complete patch to do this. I should
revive it and commit it.
