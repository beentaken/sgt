Summary: Entering wrong SSH-1 key passphrase causes PuTTY crash

<p>
When using public-key authentication in SSH-1, entering an incorrect
passphrase in the PuTTY window will cause PuTTY to crash. Correct
passphrases or Pageant authentication are fine, as is SSH-2.

<p>
I believe this is caused by <code>do_ssh1_login()</code> using its
argument <code>pktin</code> in the auth loop condition. When prompting
for a password in GUI PuTTY, that argument can become
<code>NULL</code> due to coroutine mechanics. Prior to 0.58 we didn't
use the argument. If so, this was probably introduced around r4898,
and won't affect Plink/PSCP/PSFTP.

<p>
This looks similar to a problem blocking
<a href="ssh2-password-expiry.html">`ssh2-password-expiry'</a>, so
should probably be looked into at the same time.
