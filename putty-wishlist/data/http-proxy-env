Summary: Honour the http_proxy et al environment variables
Class: wish

<p>
It might be nice if at least the command-line tools (plink et al)
could honour the commonly used environment variables
<tt>http_proxy</tt>, <tt>ftp_proxy</tt>, <tt>no_proxy</tt> (etc?),
using them to automatically configure use of PuTTY's HTTP proxy
features.

<p>
Of course, there would have to be some obvious and easy way to
override this, because in many circumstances it wouldn't be The Right
Thing to do.

<p>
I'm not sure whether there are written standards for the names and
contents of these variables anywhere or whether they're just defined
by common practice.
