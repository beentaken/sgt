<p>
PuTTY has IPv6 support in the codebase, but it's not compiled in to
the binaries we release. We don't currently have the headers and
libraries needed to compile with IPv6 support, and haven't yet got
round to getting hold of them. (Therefore, we don't test the IPv6
support, either.)  It's suggested that we could get them
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/msripv6/msripv6.htm">here</a>.

<p>
In the meantime,
<a href="http://unfix.org/projects/ipv6/">unfix.org</a> makes
available some binaries compiled with -DIPV6. But note that we haven't
personally checked them, and can't vouch for their trustworthiness.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2004-12-30</b>: Now that a kind and helpful user has donated
a more up-to-date compiler with up-to-date headers, I have
integrated unfix.org's latest patch, polished it a bit, and enabled
it by default in the nightly builds.
