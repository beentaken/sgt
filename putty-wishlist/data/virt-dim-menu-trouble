<p>
We've had a couple of reports from users of
<a href="http://virt-dimension.sourceforge.net/">Virtual Dimension</a>
that the `Close' button (the `X' on the top right of the window) is
disabled on PuTTY windows, as is the corresponding window/context menu
entry. Reports indicate that the close button is greyed sometime
during authentication.

<p>
It looks like the way PuTTY is manipulating the window menu (which it
does after a successful SSH login, to update the "Special Commands"
menu) is clashing with the way Virtual Dimension is manipulating the
same menu. r6546 changes the way we handle the "Special Commands"
menu, which has been confirmed to make the problem go away.
