Summary: Garbled packets from OpenSSH when using aes256-ctr

<p>There have been a couple of reports of PuTTY reporting "Incoming packet
was garbled on decryption", and of OpenSSH's sshd reporting "Bad packet length"
when using aes256-ctr.
<p>Both reports involved "OpenSSH_4.5p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8e 23 Feb 2007", one
on FreeBSD and one on Linux.
<p>The following changes seem to make the problem go away:
<ul><li>Using PuTTY 0.58 (no SDCTR support)
<li>Using OpenSSL 0.9.8d
<li>Using OpenSSH 3.5p1 (no SDCTR support)
<li>Using Blowfish or 3DES instead of AES
</ul>
<p>Using OpenSSH 4.4 or 4.0 (both of which support SDCTR) seems not to help.
<p>BJH has reproduced this on Viking.
