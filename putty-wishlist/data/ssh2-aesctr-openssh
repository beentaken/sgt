Summary: Garbled packets from OpenSSH when using OpenSSL 0.9.8e

<p>PuTTY reports "Incoming packet
was garbled on decryption" when connecting to versions of OpenSSH before
4.6p1 built
against OpenSSL 0.9.8e.  This is caused by a bug in OpenSSL 0.9.8e, and
is not specific to PuTTY -- configuring an unaffected version of OpenSSH to
use the same ciphers as PuTTY gives a similar result.
<p>This bug is in OpenSSH's Bugzilla as
<a href="http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1291">Bug 1291</a>.
It is <a href="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=15978">fixed</a> in
OpenSSL CVS and there is a workaround in OpenSSH 4.6p1.
<p>For those people forced to run an older OpenSSH and OpenSSL 0.9.8e,
the best workaround is to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config">configure
sshd</a> not to offer the "aes256-ctr", "aes192-ctr", or "arcfour256" ciphers.
Failing that,
<a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ssh-encryption">configure PuTTY</a>
to prefer either triple-DES or Blowfish to AES and Arcfour.
