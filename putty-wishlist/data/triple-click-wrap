Summary: Perhaps triple-click select should take account of wrapped lines

Hmm. I'd call that a semi-bug at worst -- I don't think there's any
pressing need for the triple-click selection to be a superset of the
double-click selection. (When I ask for full lines that's what I want,
so I wouldn't want the end of a wrapped word tacked on -- not that you
were suggesting that.)

However, the closest we have to a spec is xterm, and the xterm I
have[1] will select multiple lines at once when wrapped, preserving
the superset property. (I.e., if I have something wrapped over three
physical lines, the triple-click mode will select either all three
lines, or none of them.)

Personally I'm not sure I have a strong opinion either way.
