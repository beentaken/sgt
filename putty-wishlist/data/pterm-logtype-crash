Setting the logging type to SSH packet logging in Unix PuTTY, then
invoking pterm and attempting to open the "Change Settings" box gives
an assertion failure:

pterm: ../dialog.c:476: dlg_stdradiobutton_handler: Assertion `button < ctrl->radio.nbuttons' failed.

This is because pterm doesn't have an SSH packet logging mode, so it
can't represent the saved setting in its dialogue box.  The same
problem affects PuTTYtel, and similar problems may exist for other
settings.
