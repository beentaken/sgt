Summary: pterm aborts if Default Settings has SSH packet logging enabled
Present-in: 2005-02-04

Difficulty: tricky
Class: bug

Setting the logging type to SSH packet logging in Unix PuTTY, then
invoking pterm and attempting to open the "Change Settings" box gives
an assertion failure:

pterm: ../dialog.c:476: dlg_stdradiobutton_handler: Assertion `button < ctrl->radio.nbuttons' failed.

This is because pterm doesn't have an SSH packet logging mode, so it can't
represent the saved setting in its dialogue box.  I expect that the same
problem affects PuTTYtel, and similar problems may exist for other settings.
