<p>
Despite sharing large parts of the Windows API, WinCE doesn't appear
to be significantly easier to port to than a totally different
operating system.  A port is in the pipeline, although it's only in
its early stages yet.

<p>
There's a third-party port at <a
href="http://pocketputty.aleq.cz/">pocketputty.aleq.cz</a>. At the
time of writing, I don't think any of us have tried it, it's in an
early stage of development, and there's no source yet.
