<p>
It's been observed that SSH-2 "keyboard-interactive" authentication in
PuTTY only permits one attempt at authentication before falling back
to other forms of authentication, such as password-based. If no other
methods are supported by the server, PuTTY will bomb out with the
message "No supported authentication methods left to try!".

<p>
This has been exacerbated recently as several distributions are
configuring OpenSSH to use k-i for even basic password authentication
these days, and not enabling PasswordAuthentication at all by default.

<p>
As of 2005-01-08, PuTTY will continue to attempt keyboard-interactive
authentication as long as the server continues to offer it, in
preference to password authentication, unless the server refuses it
outright. (If you need to get past k-i, you can disable attempts to
use keyboard-interactive entirely on the "Auth" panel.)
