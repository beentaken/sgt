Subject: Make access to serial ports above COM9 easier on Windows

<p>
In PuTTY 0.59, if you need to use a serial port other than COM1 to
COM9 inclusive, you have to add the magic prefix <tt>\\.\</tt> (for
instance, <tt>\\.\COM10</tt>) - a fact not included in the 0.59
documentation (although we added it shortly afterwards). The same
goes for more exotically named serial ports or similar entities.

<p>
After a suitable amount of soul-searching, it seems that it would not
be unreasonable for PuTTY to automatically prepend <tt>\\.\</tt> to the
serial-line string. (This works even for the traditional serial ports
like COM1 - tested as far back as Win95.)

<p>
As a get-out in case someone finds something interesting to talk to
that <em>doesn't</em> start with <tt>\\.\</tt>, we'll avoid adding
the prefix iff the serial line string contains a backslash. (This
will also mean that existing <tt>\\.\COM10</tt> style configurations
will continue to work.)
