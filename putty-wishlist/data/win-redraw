Summary: Window redraw problems on Windows
Class: bug
Difficulty: taxing
Priority: medium
Present-in: 0.56 2005-01-13

<p>
We get occasional reports of failure to redraw parts of the PuTTY
terminal window, typically when another window is opaquely dragged
over the PuTTY window, leaving white areas on the window which can
usually be filled in by dragging another window over the PuTTY window
again. Two of us have managed to reproduce this ourselves with
vigorous window-waving.

<p>
This could be a PuTTY bug or a Windows bug. We're assured that this
probably isn't a function of the video card driver (which isn't
responsible for calculating what to redraw, just for doing what it's
told), but it may be a function of the Windows version (all reports so
far are on NT-series OSs, and my (JTN) attempts to reproduce on 98SE
didn't show anything).

<p>
(I (JTN) have a vague recollection about some misgivings and our
return value from window/dialog functions, or similar, compared to the
docs on MSDN, although this was years ago. I wonder if that could be
causing this?)

Reports:

<ul>

<li>0.56, WinXP SP2, nVidia card
<br><tt>8E5ACAE05E6B9E44A2903C693A5D4E8A04C48633@hqemmail02.nvidia.com</tt>

<li>0.56?, WinXP pre-SP2, Matrox Millennium G550 (OSD)

<li>2005-01-13, Win2K SP4, ATI RAGE 128 PRO II (JTN), 1.4GHz
<br>Quite reproducible. Unable to get Notepad to exhibit the same
behaviour on similar timescales, so it seems PuTTY-specific.
<br>(I can also trigger partial redraw failures on the configuration
dialog by the same method! -- the background

bizarrely. Also 0.56.)
