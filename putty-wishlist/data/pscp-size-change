Summary: PSCP assertion failure if remote source file changes size
Class: bug
Difficulty: tricky
Priority: high
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
If PSCP is used to copy a remote file to the local machine, and the
remote file changes in size during the transfer (e.g., an active log
file), PSCP can give an error message like "Assertion failed:
actuallen &lt;= len, file scp.c, line 1435".

<p>
(Note that the same error used to occur for static but
<a href="large-files.html">particularly large files</a>.)

<p>
This assertion is associated with the SFTP backend. A workaround may
be to persuade PSCP to use its SCP backend instead (for instance, with
the <a href="pscp-select-backend.html"><tt>-scp</tt> option</a> added
in the development snapshots); you'll avoid the assertion, but I
haven't checked that the file will be safely transferred in its
entirety.
