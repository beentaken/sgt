Summary: Vulnerability: crafted SFTP string may allow remote code execution
Class: vulnerability
Difficulty: fun
Priority: high
Present-in: 0.56
Fixed-in: 0.57
Content-type: text/x-html-body

<p>
Many versions of PSFTP and PSCP prior to 0.57 have a heap corruption
vulnerability in their treatment of string fields in the SSH File
Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

<p>
Since a string field is present in the server's response to the
<code>FXP_OPEN</code> request, this vulnerability can be triggered by
simply connecting to a malicious SFTP server.

<p>
(Note however that the vulnerability kicks in <em>after</em> host key
verification, so the host key of the server has to have been
accepted to get this far.)

<p>
SFTP is always used by PSFTP; it is also used by PSCP if available
(depending on server behaviour). It can be used in both SSH-2 and
SSH-1 (again, depending on server behaviour). Thus, a malicious server
can exploit this in all invocations of PSFTP and PSCP, unless the
<code>-scp</code> option is supplied to PSCP.

This bug was discovered by an anonymous contributor to
<a href="http://www.idefense.com/">iDEFENSE</a>'s

Contributor Program</a>. It will be documented in a forthcoming
iDEFENSE advisory.

<em>Vulnerability details:</em>
If a string length that would read off the end of the SFTP packet was
supplied, <code>sftp.c:sftp_pkt_getstring()</code> would not return a
pointer to the string, but would return the server-supplied string
length. <code>fxp_open_recv()</code> would then call <code>mkstr()</code>
with that length; with a carefully crafted length field,
<code>mkstr()</code> would <code>malloc(0)</code> due to an integer
overflow, and then <code>memcpy()</code> data from <code>*NULL</code>
to that location, leading to a heap corruption. (The data copied to
the heap is not trivially server-controlled, but it can't be ruled out
on all platforms.)
