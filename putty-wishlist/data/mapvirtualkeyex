Summary: Trouble with MapVirtualKeyEx in Korean Win98
Class: semi-bug
Priority: low
Difficulty: taxing
Content-type: text/plain

It is claimed that MapVirtualKeyEx and ToAsciiEx don't work in
Korean Win98 (although they're fine in other Korean Windows
products). Apparently in this version of Windows, MapVirtualKey and
ToAscii work fine.

It would certainly be easy enough to create a version of PuTTY that
used the non-Ex variants of the functions, which should then work on
Korean Win98. But ideally I'd like PuTTY to automatically detect
whatever the bug is, and switch between the two pairs of functions
as a result of this detection. If anyone knows how to do this, that
would be useful.

Priority is low, because as far as I can tell this is really a bug
in Korean Win98 and it shouldn't have to be PuTTY's job to work
round it.
