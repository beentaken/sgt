Summary: PuTTY doesn't correctly encode 255x255 NAWS messages
Class: bug
Difficulty: fun
Present-in: 0.53

From Thomas Thurman:

| When the telnet option NAWS is enabled, and the width or height of the
| screen is exactly 255 characters, PuTTY fails to double up the 0xFF
| byte in the subnegotiation, as required by RFC1073.

(in telnet.c:telnet_size())

| Linux telnet servers don't seem to be fazed by this, but it crashed a
| Python telnet server I was testing it on.
