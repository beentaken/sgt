Summary: Searching facilities in the scrollback

<p>
One user suggested a search facility for finding text in the
scrollback. Full-blown regexp-style grep is probably overkill, but a
Notepad-esque search box (select up/down search direction, select
case sensitivity, type your text and go) might be feasible.
