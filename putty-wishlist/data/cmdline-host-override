Summary: -load overrides a host name specified on the command line

<p>
If both <code>-load</code> and a hostname are specified on PuTTY's command
line, the hostname from the saved session takes precedence, which it
shouldn't.  This is because bare hostnames aren't passed through
<code>cmdline_process_param()</code> in the same way that (e.g.) bare port
numbers are, so they end up being trampled by
<code>cmdline_process_saved()</code>.
