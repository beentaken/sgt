Summary: Horizontal scrollbar

<p>Some people would like a horizonal scrollbar, because they want to be able
to look at things wider than the screen.  This wouldn't be analagous to the
vertical scrollbar, since that allows viewing of the (read-only) scrollback,
whereas a horizontal scrollbar would adjust which part of a larger terminal
was visible.

<p>A simple workaround for users of Unix systems is to install
<code>less</code> and use <code>less -S</code> to view their files and command
output.
