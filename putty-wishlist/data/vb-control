Summary: SSH client packaged as a Visual Basic component

A lot of people ask for a Visual Basic component that implements an
SSH client, so that they can include it in their VB programs and
automatically get securely in touch with other systems and issue
commands.

I think the simplest way to do this would be to implement it as a
thin veneer on top of the DLL front end (once we've done _that_).

The major direct difficulty in this work is that I know nothing
about VB components and how to create one, and so I can't even think
about beginning this without some outside help. But also, it can't
be done unless the DLL work is done first.
