If an SSH-2 server sends PuTTY more data than its window allows,
PuTTY gets confused, and stops sending SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST.
While such servers are buggy, PuTTY should behave better.  Simply
dropping the connection would be unnecessarily rude, especially
since overrunning the window is a recommended way to get better
performance out of naive SSH-2 implementations.  Better would be
for PuTTY to send an extra WINDOW_ADJUST to retrospectively permit
the excess data.  This is what it now does.
