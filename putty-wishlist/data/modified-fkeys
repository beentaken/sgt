<p>
We occasionally get requests to provide unique escape sequences for
function keys with more combinations of modifiers than we currently
support (e.g., Fn, Shift+Fn, Ctrl+Fn and Ctrl+Shift+Fn).

Sometimes it's even suggested what sequences these should send.
(<a href="xterm-keyboard.html">`xterm-keyboard'</a> has some
suggests, but also claims not to be trustworthy.)
