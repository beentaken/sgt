<p align=center><i>yet another remote-execution daemon for Windows</i>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
It seems to be quite common in large-company environments for
employees to be given a Windows machine on their desktop, and for
there to be Unix server machines elsewhere in the building that they
can connect to (either using Telnet or SSH, or a Windows X server
such as Exceed). Quite often there is also a dual-protocol file
server that allows the Windows machines and the Unix machines to
share at least some of their file systems.

<p>
If you're predominantly a Unix user and you find yourself in this
sort of environment, it can be quite inconvenient. Picture the
scene: at your Unix shell prompt, you've just tab-completed your way
down a ten-level path name in one of these shared file systems, in
search of a file that someone told you you needed to read. When you
find it, it turns out to be a <code>.DOC</code> Word document.

<p>
Clearly the <em>last</em> thing you want to do at this point is to
bring up a local Windows Explorer, and click your way right down the
same ten-level directory path to get back to the same file. What you
<em>really</em> want is a little utility, perhaps called
<code>wf</code> (for "Windows File"), which would automatically
translate the pathname from Unix syntax into Windows, automatically
contact your Windows machine, and ask it to launch the file with
whatever viewer program seemed appropriate.

<p>
This is the main problem that DoIt solves. It has a few other handy
features too, but the above is mainly what it's for.

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
Here is the complete list of features that DoIt provides, so that
you can tell whether it will be useful to you before downloading.

<ul>

<li>
Start a GUI program (such as Notepad, or Word, or Excel or whatever)
on the Windows machine.

<li>
Start a command-line program (such as a C compiler) on the Windows
machine, and send all its output back to the Unix client machine to
be displayed on stdout. (Note that DoIt does not currently support
two-way communication: the program sends its output back to the Unix
box, but the Unix box can't send further input to the program.)

<li>
Open a Windows file using the ShellExecute function. This is
equivalent to double-clicking on the file in Explorer: it opens the
file using whatever application Windows has configured for files of
that type.

<li>
Perform automatic path-name translation on the above, so that you
can just type "<code>wf myfile.doc</code>". DoIt will automatically
turn this into a fully-qualified Unix path name, then feed it
through a set of user-defined path name translations, and end up
with a Windows path name that accesses the same file.

<li>
Ask the Windows system to open its default web browser and visit a
specified URL. (This is particularly useful if you can't make your X
server cut and paste effectively to Windows.)

<li>
Place arbitrary text in the clipboard of the Windows machine, and
also fetch text out of the Windows clipboard back to the client.
(Again, this is particularly useful if your cut and paste between X
and Windows doesn't work properly.)

</ul>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>
DoIt is distributed under the MIT licence, so it is free to copy,
redistribute, use and reuse. For more details, see the file called
LICENCE in the distribution archive.

<p>
DoIt comes with <em>NO WARRANTY</em>. To the best of my knowledge it
works correctly and provides the level of security it tries to
provide, but I might be wrong. If you are in doubt, you should
perform your own security review of the code.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>
DoIt comes in two parts: a client and a server.

<p>
The server is a Windows user-level process. You run it in your
Windows session (perhaps in your Startup group so that it appears as
soon as you log in), and it sits in your System Tray and listens for
connections on TCP port 17481. The DoIt server does not run as a
Windows NT Service, so you do not need to be the administrator to
install it. Each user of a multi-user NT machine can install and
configure DoIt independently.

<p>
The client is a simple Unix program which performs all the necessary
path translations and then sends commands to the server. Pathname
translations must be entered manually into a configuration file on
the client Unix machine(s).

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
The protocol spoken between the client and the server is
cryptographically protected to provide confidentiality, integrity
and two-way authentication. In other words, eavesdroppers cannot
tell what commands you're sending to your Unix box or what the
responses are; active man-in-the-middle attackers cannot modify the
command you send or the response you receive without you noticing;
nobody can pretend to be your server in order to intercept the
commands you send; and crackers elsewhere on the network cannot send
their own commands to your Windows machine and convince it they're
genuine.

<p>
Unlike SSH or similar protocols, however, DoIt does not use a key
exchange phase. It relies on the client and the server
<em>already</em> having access to a shared secret key. You need to
have set this key up by some other means. (This decision is largely
taken on grounds of performance; some of DoIt's functions need to be
performed very promptly, and a second or two of cryptographic key
exchange would seriously impact this.)

<p>
If you have a shared file system between your Windows and Unix
machines, one obvious solution is to create your shared secret file
and store it on this file system. Since most network file system
protocols are not cryptographically protected, this will now be the
weak link of the system in terms of security: an attacker able to
eavesdrop on network packets will now be able to learn your shared
secret and then instruct DoIt to run any command they like on your
Windows machine. However, if this is the case then your unencrypted
network file system is likely to have been the weak link in your
internal security in any case, so DoIt will most likely not have
made matters any worse. I use this method myself and I don't think
it's a problem (but then, my company's network is fully switched, so
eavesdroppers will have a reasonably hard time anyway).

<p>
At some point it might be worth adding a standard mechanism for key
exchange which can be run every few hours independently of the data
connections. This would require some design work, and there would
also need to be public keys for the clients and servers. And for
this security enhancement to be worthwhile, you would suddenly have
to be careful <em>not</em> to store anything on the unencrypted
shared file system!

<p><i>LEGAL WARNING</i>: Since DoIt uses strong encryption, it may
be illegal to download and use it in some jurisdictions. You may find
<a href="http://rechten.uvt.nl/koops/cryptolaw/">this site</a>
useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I
can't vouch for its correctness. If there is interest, I might
consider providing a version of DoIt that uses cryptography only for
authentication and integrity protection, and does not encrypt data
against eavesdroppers.

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
The archive below contains all the DoIt source code, and a
pre-compiled Windows server executable. You will need to build the
Unix client program yourself (because it will be different on every
different Unix system). For this you will need a Unix C compiler.
Most Unix systems come with one of these, and it is probably
possible to install <code>gcc</code> on any that do not.

<p>
The DoIt archive is available as a ZIP file and as a Unix
<code>.tar.gz</code> archive:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="doit.zip">doit.zip</a>
<li>
<a href="doit.tar.gz">doit.tar.gz</a>
</ul>

<p>
<i>BE AWARE</i>
that currently the DoIt wire protocol is not finalised. If you
attempt to use one version of the DoIt server with a non-matching
version of the client, I cannot guarantee whether things will work
fully, partially, or not at all, and I also cannot guarantee that
either client or server will give sensible error messages explaining
the problem. DoIt is not very mature software yet, and I don't want
to tie myself down to supporting a broken protocol design for the
next few years. Always use matching client and server versions.
