<h2>Simon the collection of historical fact</h2>

<p>
<em>Births, marriages and deaths</em>: 3rd May 1977, none, and none,
respectively.

<p>
<em>Education</em>: changed primary schools three times but only
went to three primary schools, due to doing the same one
(<a href="http://www.dolphin.berks.sch.uk/">Dolphin, Hurst</a>)
twice.
Then 
<a href="http://www.leightonpark.reading.sch.uk/">Leighton Park,
Reading</a>;
<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge University</a>;
hard knocks. Mostly in that order.

<p>
<em>Employment</em>: three varied and mostly interesting summer jobs
at Digital (as was), followed by my current full-time job at
<a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a>.

<h2>Simon the human being</h2>

<p>
I live in Cambridge, near a large group of friends who I met at the
University. Some are still students; some have become real people;
some have left the university but are still utterly surreal. I have
affiliations with
<a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/">the sinister Green End
organisation</a>
and the mysterious
<a href="http://www.tartarus.org/">Tartarus</a>
(otherwise known as the Gallery, for reasons too odd to repeat). Oh,
and I know some number of the users of
<a href="http://www.mono.org/">Monochrome</a>. (See
<a href="eliza.txt">this transcript</a> for one of the funniest
things I ever saw happen on Monochrome...)

<p>
I'm not a goth. Many goths say this, but I'm <em>really</em> not
one. Well, OK, I wear black. And I like goth music. And regularly go
to goth clubs. Argh, and I've been known to wear silly goth outfits
when I go. But I'm <em>still</em> not a goth.

<p>
I used to play the violin; I gave up when I was 14 or 15, because I
got sick of being pressured to practice all the time. I don't regret
it, much, although I do wish I did more music. I used to compose a
lot; just to show you what a nice guy I am, I won't inflict any of
it on you here.

<p>
When I was about ten, I was forever dropping and breaking things. I
was the clumsiest kid I knew. Then one day I saw one of those "never
a dull moment" books, with a double spread on how to learn to
juggle, and I picked up three balls and went "<em>Right</em>! Nobody is
<em>ever</em> going to call me clumsy again." I don't juggle so much
these days, but I can still do it reasonably well if the occasion
arises.

<p>
I like science fiction, or magical fantasy, depending what mood I'm
in. I like destructive computer games, and I don't like computer
games that require thought, because my job and enough of my other
hobbies require thought, and when I play games I like to switch off
and blast things mindlessly.

<p>
I also like cheese, and chicken, and curry, and garlic, and pizza.
And I think whoever invented Chicken Kiev should have been given
more medals.

<p>
For some reason, I seem to have acquired two photos of
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~johns/">John Sullivan</a>
in embarrassing clothing. I don't quite know how I managed to end up
with two of them, but lest they be lost to the world, here are
dignity-destroying pictures of this Cambridge goth legend in
<a href="js10039pink.jpeg">a pink cardigan</a>
and in
<a href="js10039punt.jpeg">a daft hat</a>.

<p>
I have no sense of smell. Most people who find this out tend to ask
me the same questions, so here's a <a href="smell.html">FAQ</a>
about it.

<h2>Simon the geek</h2>

<p>
I've been doing computers for most of my life, ever since my
well-meaning parents bought a 16K Spectrum when I was five and I
started reading the manual. By the time I was nine, I could write
reasonably complex things that worked, and my dad had attempted to
teach me C (unsuccessfully; eight-year-olds don't take well to
pointer arithmetic). By the time I was fifteen, I was writing
serious things that the people and occasionally small businesses
around me were finding useful; by the time I started at university,
it was clear that I wasn't going to be concentrating on my maths
degree nearly as much as on my free-time hacking. Now I work at
<a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a>,
but I still try to find time
to benefit the <em>rest</em> of humanity when I'm not at work.

<p>
Type "<code>man&nbsp;console_codes</code>" at a Linux machine, and
in the section that describes the escape sequences for changing the
colour palette, you'll see a frowny bemoaning the fact that the
sequences conflict with established policy on escape sequence
layouts. This was my fault: those sequences were my contribution to
the Linux kernel, along with an enhancement or two to the virtual
console scrollback.

<p>
I was sitting on one of the Intel x86 assembly language newsgroups
one day when someone started bemoaning the lack of a decent free
Intel assembler (all of them being either not decent, or not free,
or not either). Being a young and idealistic student, I accepted the
challenge and found myself becoming the primary developer in the
<a href="http://nasm.sourceforge.net/">Netwide Assembler Project</a>.
I left the project a few years ago, because a full time job made it
infeasible; it still seems to be active, though.

<p>
Once upon a time, I had a vision that maybe it would be possible to
take the Linux telnet implementation, and the xterm front end, and
hack them together to form a terminal-emulator-and-telnet client
which should then be relatively easy to port to Win32. So I tried
it. It was an utter failure: I have <em>never</em> found two more
mutually hostile pieces of software. So I re-implemented a terminal
emulator, and Telnet, from scratch, and produced a thing called
STel. While avoiding revising for my exams in 1998, I accidentally
implemented an SSH back end, and 
<a href="putty/">PuTTY</a>
was born. It's still an active project.

<p>
Those are the highlights of my various computer-related activities,
but there are quite a few lesser things I've done. Return to my
<a href="./">home page</a> and browse around the rest of my site if
you're interested.
