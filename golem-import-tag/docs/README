The command syntax, as advertised in HHMT, is

such as

[1m   anakin[m !golem 'amf revoke


----------------

To do:

  Ensure deferred messages are counted on login, to avoid them
    being seen as recent when live messages arrive
  Watch All Users
  Sit on Users On
  Sit in talker
  Sit in Main Menu
  Deal with talker wakes
  Examine users

  Debug Loew
  Integrate Loew

  Become able to receive Loew commands in the talker, in messages,
    and from the local machine

  Create a talker personality

  Rationalise the logging and diagnostic mechanisms

  Repeatedly revoke Amf's security descriptor when he starts trying
    to hack it, until he gets pissed off

  Maybe send messages

  Maybe add edits to things

  Maybe be able to assume blank namelines
