<p>
This is the home page for Enigma, a puzzle game involving falling
blocks, exploding bombs, and pushing stuff around. It has elements
of Boulderdash and elements of Sokoban, and anybody old enough to
remember XOR on the Spectrum will see large elements of that in it.

<p>
I can't claim credit for inventing Enigma; the game rules were
devised by somebody else, who also designed the twelve original
levels. He wishes to remain anonymous, so he has donated the levels
to the public domain. This reimplementation of the game engine is
done in C, from scratch, by me.

<p>
Enigma is intended to run on any Unix system with a working
<code>libcurses</code> (or <code>libncurses</code>), which should be
most of them. In particular, it's been tested on Debian GNU/Linux
2.2, Red Hat Linux 6.1, and Solaris.

<p>
The source archive for Enigma is available for download here. I hope
RPM and Debian packages will appear in due course.

(You might want to read
<a href="../bugs.html">this article</a>
before reporting a bug.) Patches are welcome. If anybody wants to
design any extra levels, or write a man page, those would be
<em>very</em> welcome.

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: There is another puzzle game called Enigma, which
seems to have appeared around 2002 (the game on <em>this</em> page
dates from 2000). The other game is mouse-controlled, fully
graphical, and involves a marble, whereas this one is
keyboard-controlled, text-only and involves a moving <code>@</code>
sign. If you don't recognise the screenshot shown on this page, you
might have come to the wrong page, and you might want to be looking
<a href="http://gnuwin.epfl.ch/apps/enigma/en/">here</a> instead.
