Release FIXME
-------------

 - Makefile adjustments: ensure bogus stuff left in `levels'
   directory doesn't get hit by `make install', and ensure it
   doesn't get hit by tarball generator either. The `CVS' directory,
   for example.
 - Introduced loading and saving of move sequences. You can press
   `w' during the game to save the sequence of moves that have got
   you to that point; pressing `m' during the game lets you load a
   sequence of moves, and then goes into `movie mode' in which you
   can step back and forth through the process of playing those
   moves, and finally hit `q' to enact the whole lot and return to
   normal playing mode. Hence players can swap their best or
   weirdest solutions to a particular level.
 - Everyone's favourite interface change: you can now hit `r' to
   restore a saved position on the `you have died' screen just as
   you can within the game, so you don't have to go back round via
   the main menu.

Release 1.03
------------

 - Ensure save files are written with perms 0600 (only the saving
   user can read or write them, despite setgid on the enigma
   binary), and ensure progress files are written 0640 (the games
   group can read them, so enigma can build a Hall of Fame when I
   implement that).
 - Disallow periods and slashes in level set names, to confine
   Enigma to reading and writing files _only_ in its designated
   level and save directories. Might just have been a security hole,
   although I can't immediately see a way.

Release 1.02
------------

 - We no longer repeat the game-completed screen when the user
   recompletes a level after having completed the game.
 - Error handling improved so we don't segfault on trying to restore
   a nonexistent save, and also so we don't segfault if we can't
   find our level set.
 - Fixed various bugs in the level-titles list box on the main menu,
   which don't show up in the standard level set but might if people
   start designing longer ones.

Release 1.01
------------

 - configure script now chooses more sensibly between curses and
   ncurses, and also checks whether *curses.h defines attr_t. Now
   able to compile on Solaris/gcc.
 - Renamed config.h to settings.h to stop it being blown away by
   make distclean.
 - Added CHANGELOG.

Release 1.0
-----------

 - Initial release.
