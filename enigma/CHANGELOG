Release FIXME
-------------

 - Disallow periods and slashes in level set names, to confine
   Enigma to reading and writing files _only_ in its designated
   level and save directories. Might just have been a security hole,
   although I can't immediately see a way.

Release 1.02
------------

 - We no longer repeat the game-completed screen when the user
   recompletes a level after having completed the game.
 - Error handling improved so we don't segfault on trying to restore
   a nonexistent save, and also so we don't segfault if we can't
   find our level set.
 - Fixed various bugs in the level-titles list box on the main menu,
   which don't show up in the standard level set but might if people
   start designing longer ones.

Release 1.01
------------

 - configure script now chooses more sensibly between curses and
   ncurses, and also checks whether *curses.h defines attr_t. Now
   able to compile on Solaris/gcc.
 - Renamed config.h to settings.h to stop it being blown away by
   make distclean.
 - Added CHANGELOG.

Release 1.0
-----------

 - Initial release.
